CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 40

2
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,326
Just try it once... See how the
three of us dance together.

3
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,261
I've reserved a studio to
practice at from today

4
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,230
until the audition.

5
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,265
I'm going to practice
there by myself.

6
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,533
You two do your best.

7
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,036
What are you going to do?

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,438
Shall we do it with just
the two of us then?

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,055
Since coming to Tokyo, this
will be her first real

10
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,425
audition, and Hitomi is going
to give it all she's got.

11
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,506
I'm home!

12
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,745
You're just in time.

13
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,413
We were just about
to start eating

14
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,848
at this very moment.

15
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,585
Really? Thank you so much for
preparing dinner, everybody.

16
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,688
Also, thank you so much for
letting me do what I want

17
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,156
for the past few days.

18
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,425
Once the auditions is over
tomorrow, I'll go back to

19
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,727
doing what I'm supposed to do.

20
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,128
But if you pass the audition,
you'll be doing the promotion

21
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,329
video, won't you?

22
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,898
I'll just be one of the
background dancers...

23
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,566
If that promotion video
comes out on television,

24
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,134
you'll be on it, too,
won't you?

25
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,569
I might be.

26
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,904
Do your best, Hitomi.

27
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,871
Thank you.

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,406
They're all rooting for you.

29
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,908
While we were preparing
dinner tonight, they

30
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,343
all worked hard without
complaining once.

31
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,945
Thank you.

32
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:06,084
These... auditions depend
a lot on luck, so just

33
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,354
do your best, and don't let
the pressure get to you...

34
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,589
If you get in, it would
be nice... If not...

35
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,391
I'll do my best.

36
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,393
Hitomi!

37
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,061
Yes?

38
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,766
Just the person
I wanted to see...

39
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,936
You have that auction
tomorrow, don't you?

40
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,137
Audition...

41
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,806
So being superstitious,
I thought I'd bring

42
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,108
you something for good
luck, so I got you

43
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,312
some "katsu" (to win)...
It's liver "katsu" (cutlet).

44
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,814
I brought enough for
the children, too.

45
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,149
Thank you!

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,919
To thank you for the pot
stew the other night.

47
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,555
It smells good.

48
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,557
May we come in?

49
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,092
Come on in.

50
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,894
Good evening.

51
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,863
Thank you for the pot
stew the other right.

52
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,966
You have that thing tomorrow,
don't you, Hitomi...?

53
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,434
I brought you this.

54
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,569
"Katsuobushi" (dried bonito flakes)?

55
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,540
It's something that we give out
to our special customers.

56
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,176
When you're faced with
a challenge...

57
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,411
It has the character
"katsu" (to win)...

58
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,714
That's awesome!

59
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,783
There are four inside, so
give them to the "gals"

60
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,885
that came the other night.

61
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,053
Especially to Yuka...

62
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,155
Since we said things
that upset her.

63
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,258
All right. I'll give
this to them.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,027
See how worried everyone
is about you, Hitomi...

65
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,295
You'll have to do
your best...

66
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,429
I'll do my best.

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,265
I'll call whether
I win or lose.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,867
I'll bet you don't
think you'll lose.

69
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,202
I won't lose.

70
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,672
Thank you!

71
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,747
It's the day of
the audition.
(Club BROCKS)

72
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,608
The people in Tsukishima
are so nice, aren't they?

73
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,909
Giving ns somet Ing
like this.

74
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,544
What good is it going to do
for you to take this

75
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,612
You're not even
auditioning

76
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,746

He felt
bad about what
he did to you. so

87
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,871
he wanted me to give
you this.

88
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,807
See? It says "katsu.'

I don't think that way...

94
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,888
I don't like pretending
to be friends

95
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,126
Who do you think
you are!

96
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,261
Don't waste your power

97
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,469
It's KEN, -iitomi

00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,908
Hitomi! Appeal

99
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,780
You talked to KEN at the event
the other night, didn't you?

100
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,682
Just for a little bit

101

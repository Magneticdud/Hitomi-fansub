CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 40

2
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,320
Just try it once... See how the
three of us dance together.

3
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,260
I've reserved a studio to
practice at from today

4
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,230
until the audition.

5
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,260
I'm going to practice
there by myself.

6
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,530
You two do your best.

7
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,030
What are you going to do?

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,430
Shall we do it with just
the two of us then?

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,050
Since coming to Tokyo, this
will be her first real

10
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,420
audition, and Hitomi is going
to give it all she's got.

11
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm home!

12
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,740
You're just in time.

13
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,410
We were just about
to start eating

14
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,840
at this very moment.

15
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,580
Really? Thank you so much for
preparing dinner, everybody.

16
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,680
Also, thank you so much for
letting me do what I want

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,150
for the past few days.

18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,420
Once the auditions is over
tomorrow, I'll go back to

19
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,720
doing what I'm supposed to do.

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,120
But if you pass the audition,
you'll be doing the promotion

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
video, won't you?

22
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,890
I'll just be one of the
background dancers...

23
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,560
If that promotion video
comes out on television,

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,130
you'll be on it, too,
won't you?

25
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,560
I might be.

26
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,900
Do your best, Hitomi.

27
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,870
Thank you.

28
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,400
They're all rooting for you.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,900
While we were preparing
dinner tonight, they

30
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,340
all worked hard without
complaining once.

31
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,940
Thank you.

32
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,080
These... auditions depend
a lot on luck, so just

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,350
do your best, and don't let
the pressure get to you...

34
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,580
If you get in, it would
be nice... If not...

35
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,390
I'll do my best.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,390
Hitomi!

37
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,060
Yes?

38
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,760
Just the person
I wanted to see...

39
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,930
You have that auction
tomorrow, don't you?

40
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,130
Audition...

41
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,800
So being superstitious,
I thought I'd bring

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,100
you something for good
luck, so I got you

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,310
some "katsu" (to win)...
It's liver "katsu" (cutlet).

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,810
I brought enough for
the children, too.

45
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,140
Thank you!

46
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,910
To thank you for the pot
stew the other night.

47
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,550
It smells good.

48
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,550
May we come in?

49
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,090
Come on in.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,890
Good evening.

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,860
Thank you for the pot
stew the other right.

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,960
You have that thing tomorrow,
don't you, Hitomi...?

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,430
I brought you this.

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,560
"Katsuobushi" (dried bonito flakes)?

55
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,540
It's something that we give out
to our special customers.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,170
When you're faced with
a challenge...

57
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,410
It has the character
"katsu" (to win)...

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,710
That's awesome!

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,780
There are four inside, so
give them to the "gals"

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,880
that came the other night.

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,050
Especially to Yuka...

62
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,150
Since we said things
that upset her.

63
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,250
All right. I'll give
this to them.

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,020
See how worried everyone
is about you, Hitomi...

65
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,290
You'll have to do
your best...

66
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,420
I'll do my best.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,260
I'll call whether
I win or lose.

68
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,860
I'll bet you don't
think you'll lose.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,200
I won't lose.

70
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,670
Thank you!

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,740
It's the day of the audition.
(Club BROCKS)

72
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,600
The people in Tsukishima
are so nice, aren't they?

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
Giving us something
like this.

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,540
What good is it going to do
for you to take this?

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,610
You're not even
auditioning.

76
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,740
Don't say that...

77
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,940
I'll be dancing with
you in spirit.

78
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,310
Yuka's here.

79
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,050
Yuka!

80
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,480
I know there's been a
lot between us, but

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,990
let's do our best, ok?

82
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,450
Here you go... "Katsuobushi".

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,990
What is this?

84
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,290
You know that dimwit named
Yuzo who was having pot

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
stew with us at the house...

86
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,330
He felt bad about what
he did to you, so

87
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,870
he wanted me to give
you this...

88
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,800
See? It says "katsu"
For good luck.

89
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,170
I'm your enemy...

90
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,310
And you're giving me
"katsuobushi"?

91
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,580
Why not? It just means
I want us both to do

92
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,040
our best, that's all.

93
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,380
I don't think that way...

94
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,880
I don't like pretending
to be friends.

95
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,120
Who do you think
you are!

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,260
Don't waste your power.

97
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,460
It's KEN, Hitomi.

98
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,900
Hitomi! Appeal!

99
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,780
You talked to KEN at the event
the other night, didn't you?

100
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,680
Just for a little bit.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,380
That's right... You didn't know
who he was, and you

102
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,780
treated him like some ordinary
middle-aged guy didn't you?

103
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm sure he remembers you.

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,950
But what am l going
to say to him?

105
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,020
Say an anything you want.
Just get over there!

106
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,960
KEN!

107
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,030
We met here the other
night, didn't we?

108
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,870
You're in RAY's class,
aren't you?

109
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,140
Yes... My name is
Hitomi Ippongi.

110
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm going to be one of those
auditioning today..

111
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,610
I won't play favorites...

112
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,680
I'll judge everyone
equally.

113
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,380
Thank you all
for waiting!

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
We'll start the auditions for
the d-Darts' background

115
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,790
dancers now!

116
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,500
Let me introduce you to
today's main host...

117
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,870
They're going to be major
players in the dance scene...

118
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,410
Here are the d-D-a-r t-s,
the d-Darts!

119
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,840
Give them a hand!

120
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,820
If we get in, we'll be dancing
with them, won't we?

121
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm so excited!

122
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,300
The audition started...

123
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,380
Just remember what you
practiced, and give it

124
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,090
all you've got.

125
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,020
Don't think of it as a test,
just relax!

126
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,220
Understand?

127
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm getting nervous.

128
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,370
Maybe you should eat
the "katsuobushi".

129
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,800
Isn't that for cats?

130
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,470
But since you have it,
eat it for good luck.

131
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,380
Shall we eat it?

132
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,510
Ok.

133
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,530
It tastes like soup base.

134
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,500
I think I feel like I'm
going to win now.

135
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Do your best.

136
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,400
We will.

137
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,350
Next we have entry
number seven...

138
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,180
Here's Yuka from HIPZ...

139
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
Give her a hand.

140
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,240
It's just as I thought...
She's good.

141
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,540
Lets just go up there, and
show some attitude.

142
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,880
Since we ate the
"katsuobushi".

143
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,760
That was entry number seven...

144
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,490
Yuka from HIPZ.

145
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,430
Give her a hand.

146
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,770
It's been a blistering dance
battle up until now...

147
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,370
Good job.

148
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,680
Next, we have entry
number eight...

149
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,980
Also from HIPZ...
Junko and Hitomi!

150
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,620
Give them a hand!

151
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,990
Let's go!

152
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,460
That was entry number eight.

153
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,030
Junko and Hitomi
from HIPZ...

154
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,560
Give them a hand!

155
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,270
Good job.

156
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,140
I made a mistake.

157
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,740
It's okay... You got past it.

158
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,380
Good work!

159
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,000
After all of the groups
had a chance to audition,

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,200
it's time now for the
judges' decision.

161
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm going to announce
the winners now...

162
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Entry number four...
Mika and Emi from

163
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,610
the Aoyama Dance School!

164
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,450
Come up on stage...

165
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,050
Mika and Emi...
Congratulations!

166
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:32,130
Laugh or cry... This is
the final winner today...

167
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,240
The winners is from HIPZ!

168
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,350
She was so nervous, she
felt like running away.

169
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,350
To be continued...

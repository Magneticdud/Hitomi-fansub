CHAPTER 13
The Birth of ROSE MARY
Episode 76

00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,525
We're called the
Blue Shoes.

3
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,727
What's your name?

4
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,996
ROSE MARY

5
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,767
That's a nice name.

6
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,636
Then show us..

7
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,705
How you dance
here in Tokyo!

8
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,108
We'll show you
what we can do

9
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,476
Let's go outside

10
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,283
I'll show you

11
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,691
A dance battle had begun
in Tsukishima.

12
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,693
Clap your hands!

13
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,799
Let me, Kazu

14
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,469
Hitomi.. i II yu.

15
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,306
Which one was better?

16
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,474
It was...

17
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,410
Clap your hands!

18
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,049
Let me, Kazu

19
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,253
I'll go, Hitomi

20
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,063
What about this one..

21
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,631
Which one?

22
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,299
Who was better?

23
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,734
Don't ask me

28
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,126
What are you doing?

29
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,561
You're disturbing
the neighbors

30
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,662
Break it up

31
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,563
I'm sorry

32
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,231
We're leaving
right away

33
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,566
Good work

34
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,867
Make sure you leave.

35
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,575
Shall we finish this
on the stage then?

36
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,146
Are you taking lessons
somewhere?

Thank you for helping
out all the time...

44
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,286
Please take care of the
store again today.

45

Just leave it to us.

Do your best, ROSE MARY!

58
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,451
We will!

59
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,120
Thank you, everybody

60
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,456
Shall we go?

61
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,459
We're going to our
dance lesson now.

62
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,627
Do your best!

63
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,468
You look good
in that, Ume

64
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,069
Do I?

65
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,571
It's all the years
of experience.

66
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,097
That's good, Yuka.

67
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,065
Hike it

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,767
think ito, if the
three of us can do it

69
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,235
That was great. Yuka!

70
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,870
That was super cool!

71
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,055
We won't think about the
individual award anymore

72
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,024
the only way we can win
against those girls

73
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,726
is if we win that contest!

74
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,530
It'll be ROSE MARY'S
showcase, won't it?

75
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,566
Shall we do our toes y

76
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,626
You almost got it.

79
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,352
Your timing is off,
Hitomi.

80
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,287
Once more!

81
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm glad we had this
training camp.

82
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,261

I'm clad to, e r^ra.

86
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,405
Hitomi... Your timing was
off during the climax

87
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,142
I know

88
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,547
We still have time

90
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,018
I'll practice.

91
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,310
Once more.

92
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,442
On the last day of their
training camp, "Mr. Ho Ik

93
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,144
invited them out on
his fishing boat to give

94
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,013
them a change of scenery

95
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,450
Be carefu!!

96
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,388
Thank you

97
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,357
Be careful!

98
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,860
This is Mori.. He'll
be piloting the boat.

99
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,831
G 1 to it.

100
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,701
While the boat is moving,
it's really dangerous,

101
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,037
so be sure you stay seated.

102
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,807
When you're on the boat,
you're very masculine,

103
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,342
aren't you, Mr. Honda?

104
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,410
Am P

105
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,647
He's normally very quiet,
but when you really need

106
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,615
him, you can count on him.

107
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,452
Pon-chan.. Remember the
time you saved me when

108
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,920
I was drowning?

109
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,423
That's right. If I hadn't
jumped in, you'd be dead.

110
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,558
You almost drowned?

111
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,659
Really?

112
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,462
When we were in
middle school

113
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,798
At a time like that, you
don't think about the

114
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,533
Before I realized it, I had

115
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,968
jumped into the water

116
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,836
My dad threw me a flotation
ring, and I grabbed on

117
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,705
to it, and it saved
my i e oo.

118
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,174
Then the two of you
almost drowned?

119
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,844
When something like that
happens, you become

120
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,546
lifelong friends

121
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,016
I'm hoping that someday
he almost drowns, and

122
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,919
I can jump in, and
save his life

123
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,722
And we can both drown
together again

124
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,691
That's how it'll
end up, won't it?

125
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,027
Give me a hand.

126
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,899
There are a four "gals"
here, watching...

Is that Tsukiji?

There's the Tokyo Tower!

134
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,133
Was it this close?

135
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,702
It's close, isn't it?

What are you doing?

141
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,320
We're practicing
our dance

142
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,457
Are you going to enter
the contest, too?

143
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,526
No, we're not!

144
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,161
We're practicing to show
it to Hitomi

145
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,730
You are? Do your best.

146
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:25,303
Hey should we call you
aunty, or uncle?

147
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,706
How should I answer that...

148
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,010
I'm human

You must be mistaken??...

160
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,246
Maybe you nodded off and
you were dreaming.

00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,414
That can't!

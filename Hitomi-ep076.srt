o e sure ou stay seated.

102
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,807
When you're on Jhe boat,
you're very masculine,

103
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,342
aren't you, Mr. Honda?

107
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,452
Pon-chan.. 7 ^Remember the
time you saved me when

108
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,920
I wasxJrowning?

109
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,423
That's right. If I hadn't
jumped in, you'd be dead.

110
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,558
You almost drowned?

111
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,659
Really?

112
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,462
When we werfe in
middle school

113
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,798
At a time like that, you
don't think about the

114
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,533
I realized -it, I had

115
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,968
jumped into the water

116
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,836
My dad threw me a flotation
ring, and i grabbed on

117
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,705
to it, and jt saved
my i e oo.

118
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,174
Then the *wo of you
almost drowned?

119
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,844
When something like that
happens, you become

120
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,546
lifelong friends

121
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,016
I'm hoping that someday
he almost drowns, and

122
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,919
I can jump in, and
save his life

123
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,722
And we can both drown
together again

124
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,691
That's how it'll
end up, won't it?

125
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,027

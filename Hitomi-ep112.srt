00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:24,016
Powerful rivals appeared
one after another

5
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,119
It made Hitomi realize
a11 over again the

00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,688
high level of talent needed
to get to Dance Beat

00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:08,460
That was BLUE SHOES!

10
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,804
Kazu! Why did you change
the dance steps?

11
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,306
The audience
was shocked

12
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,475
At this rate, we're
going to lose

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,314
I'm sorry, ail of you

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,987
When I thought about what
my brother would say if

15
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,689
he saw me dancing so
filled with pain, I just

16
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,192
couldn't go on

17
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,730
I started thinking I want
to enjoy dancing more

18
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,568
Kazu...?

19
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,305
I'm so sorry

20
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,375

21
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,981
I I was the best

22
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,485

U tie...! Dad's here

33
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,101
I ran all the way...

34
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,070
I wanted to make it
here in time

35
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,572
I feel like Mike Hashire Merusu
(Japanese drama)

36
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,342
You look like a "hashire
surume" {running squid)

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,043
Here's your video

Shota

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,784
Shota sent you a message
in a video letter

41
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,486
to cheer you on

42
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,522

Hitomi! How are you?

46
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,418
I'm fine!

47
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,256
I'll always treasure the
ball you gave me

48
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,326
One of my friends on the
baseball team asked me

49
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,095
to give it to him, but
I didn't give it to him.

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,564
Don't give it away

day we first met?

100
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,933
It was in front
of the school

101
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,102
Moe suddenly came up to me,
and tried to pick me up

102
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,504
She tried to
pick you up?

the test for Ray's class

105
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,678
And I got up the courage
to approach you.

106
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,515
If you hadn't come up to
me that time, we wouldn't

00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,284
be here, would we?

108
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,057
I owe it to you that I made
friends with Yuka and Junko

109
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,193
Encounters are strange,
aren't they?

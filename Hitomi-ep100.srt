00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,652
We're going to
quit dancing.

6
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,365
Yuka! Junko!

7
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,114
What's wrong?

8
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,518
I'm sorry...I had
a weird dream.

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,061
Hitomi!

10
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,363
What's wrong, Hitomi?

00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,043
Yuka and Junko aren't
here after all

15
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,480
They both turned off
their cell phones.

00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,756
This is no time for me
to be dancing

26
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,292
If I don't take the offer, they'll
have to shut down the

restaurant, won't they?

28
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,133
Come back! Come back!

29
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,751
Hello

30
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,988
Where are you now,
at a karaoke room?

31
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,991
I'm at home...That's
Grandpa singing.

32
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,326
How misleading

33
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,430
I'm at Makoto's place with
people from my company.

34
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,132
We're celebrating again

35
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,667
That's right... We got
another client

36
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,868
Won't you come, too?

37
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,271
Akira. Yuria

38
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,440
My mom asked me
to meet her...

39
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,209
Is it OK if I go?

You have to "keppare"
in your work

43
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,919
I am "keppatteru"

44
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,254
You have to "keppare"
more since you're

45
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,656
the only guy here

46
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,557

Is thto it?

54
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:11,543
It happens at work, too.

55
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,645
Someone's bothered by
what's happening at

56
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,415
home and can't concentrate
on their work

57
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,184
it's happened to
them, too.

58
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,654
What do you do when
that happens?

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,357
I let them alone
for a while

60
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,459
If they make a mistake
I'll overlook it

61
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,562
Even if I'm really worried,
I'll just bear with it

62
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,631
and wait until they
settle down

63
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,233
I don't have
to do that

64
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,071
We have to turn in our
entry by next week

65
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,576
Don't you remember when you
first came to Tsukishima

66
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,878
and you were torn between
your dancing and taking

67
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,748
care of the children,
and you collapsed7

68
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,085
I did that,
didn't I?

69
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,189
I thought I couldn't

-Thfe childr el "fed me

71
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,565
That's what you have to
do for Yuka and Junko

72
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,670
Do your best
Try harder!

73
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:00,952


74
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,053


75
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,021


76
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,423
Hitomi!

77
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,562
What's wrong?

78
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,764


79
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,899
We thought we'd tell
you tonight

80
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,966
We thought we'd tell
you tonight

81
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:17,869
What is it?

82
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,437
What is it?

83
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,340


84
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,910
We talked it over

85
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,014


86
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,483
We're not going to
enter Dance Beat

87
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:33,385


88
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,555
Let's disband
ROSE MARY

89
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,761
It's impossible!

90
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,764
Junko and I are too worried
about our families

91
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,635
Don't say that.

92
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,371
We've come this
far together.

93
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,175
We won the Summer Contest.

94
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,411
If we work hard enough,
we'll get through the

95
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,012
preliminaries, too

96
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,215
That's what I thought
until last week, too.

97
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,299
Look at this..

98
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,702
We've already filled
out the entry

99
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,971
Tear it up and
throw it away

100
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,883
Yuka! Junko!

101
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,588
I'll do whatever it takes.

102
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,826
I don't know what
I can do, but

103
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,830
I'll give you whatever
support you need

104
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,071
In any case

105
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,307
It's impossible now

106
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,776


107
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,093
I can't dance feeling
like this.

108
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,277
I'm sorry

109
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,694
Hitomi... What's wrong?
-y did something happen

110
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,940
I'll get it.

112
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,547

114
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,818
How are you?

115
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,053
I'm fine.

116
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,755
We're all fine
over here.

117
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,592
Hello... Shota?
It's Yuria

118
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,993
How are you?

119
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,827
I'm fine.

120
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,029
Me, too

121
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,297
Yuria...I want to
talk to him, too.

122
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,632
I'll let you
talk to Dad

123
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,403
Hello, Shota! It's Dad
How are you?

124
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,171
I'm going to school now

125
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,406
You're going to
school now?

126
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,207
How's your mother?

127
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,642
She's fine

128
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,844
Did you make friends?

129
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,680
Lots of friends

130
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,747
Really?

131
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,782
My turn..

132
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,284
Hello? I'll let you
talk to Hitomi now

133
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,519
Here she is.

134
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,089
Hello, Shota
It's Hitomi

135
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,794
Hitomi... I'm on the
youth baseball team

136
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,064
I'm Number Seven
on second base

137
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,333
You're doing well,
aren't you7

138
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,537
Are you working hard
at your dancing?

139
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,840
I am

140
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,645
Dance Beat is coming up
pretty soon isn't it?

141
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,015
Next month

142
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,984
I don't know if I can come 
and see you dance, but

143
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,853
I'll be rooting
for you

144
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,755
I'll be rooting
for you, Hitomi

145
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,292
Thank you.

146
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,494
Do your best.

147
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,200
Shota.

148
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,303
Hitomi?

149
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,637
What's wrong?

150
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,005
What did he say7

151
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,273
Shota! What did
you say to her?

152
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,208
It's not him

153
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,275
Hitomi?

154
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,443
It's not you...
I'm sorry

155
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,745
I'm okay

156
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,654
I see?!i Is that

157
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:45,096
I think Yuka and Junko
still want to dance

158
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,236
But I don't know what
to tell them

159
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,108
I wonder if it's


160
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:07,552
My teacher said... Don't
give in to our feelings

161
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,588
v in vitb our will

162
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,957
What does that mean7

163
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,527
When you think it's no
good, it's just the

164
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,363
way you're feeling
right at the moment.

167
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,672

I'll do my best on my
entrance exams, so

171
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,314
don't give up Hitomi

172
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,155
What a good thing to say

173
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,159
He's right, Hitomi

174
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,461

You taught me, didn t you?

180
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,876
Doesn't that mean "do

182
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,147

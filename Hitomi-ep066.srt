CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 66

2
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,759
Was it a summer cold?

3
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,861
Shota had a fever

4
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,965
The doctor's office
is closed already

5
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,669
I have some medicine
I'll go and get it

6
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,674
I won't drink
your medicine

7
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,245
Why not? Why do
you say that?

8
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,816
Because

9
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,120
You're Dad's enemy
aren't you?

10
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,592
You're Dad's enemy.

11
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,433
I'm not his enemy

12
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,934
I'm his daughter

13
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,005
Then why do you
fight with Dad?

14
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,210
I'm going to Dad

15
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,213
Dad's in the hospital.

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,349
Then I'm going to Mom.

17
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,552
You can't ^thal...
You have a fever

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,754
Come back

19
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,298

I was little.

44
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,250
You made it for me, too,
didn't you, Mom?

You made it for me, too,
didn't you, Mom?

Mom made it for me before

You're right, I remember
rmking this too

51
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,470
This is Mom's Tiediane,

You finally decided
to drink it, huh?

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,714
Just try and
taste it

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,726

Where?

65
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,791
In the kitchen..

66
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,361
When I came home in the
evening, she was

67
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,396
down in the kitchen,
and crying.

68
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,433
Was it because Aunty and
Dad didn't get along?

69
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,572
She might have wanted
to see Hitomi.

I feel bad for Mom.

73
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,924
It's the only
thing I regret

74
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,133
It's OK... what is it?

75
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,606
Why did you and Dad fight?

76
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,085
Hitomi's dad asked Dad to
sell this house, and lend

77
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,955
him the money

78
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,427
Dad got angry, and said
it was outrageous.

79
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,196
What did you do?

80
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:17,769
I was his wife, so I asked
him to lend us the money

81
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,907
But wasn't that
in the past?

82
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,211
That was when Hitomi
was three years old

83
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,380
But Dad hasn't gotten
over his feelings

84
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,750

Are you awake, Shota?

00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,944

His fever went down.

The hot ginger
tea worked

102
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,451
It went down?

You're right
It did!

104
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,458

105
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,729
Where are you
going, Shota?

106
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,297

107
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,466
He's still sleeping

108
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,937

114
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,636
At first Shota didn't
want to drink it, but

115
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,571
after taking one sip
he said, "It tastes

116
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,907
like Mom" and he drank
the whole thing

117
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,979
By morning, his fever had
gone down completely

118
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,815
Grandma's hot ginger tea really
is something, isn't it?

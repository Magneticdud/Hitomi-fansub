CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 66

2
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,759
Was it a summer cold?

3
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,861
Shota had a fever

4
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,965
The doctor's office
is closed already

5
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,669
I have some medicine
I'll go and get it

6
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,674
I won't take
your medicine

7
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,245
Why not? Why do
you say that?

8
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,816
Because

9
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,120
You're Dad's enemy
aren't you?

10
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,592
You're Dad's enemy.

11
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,433
I'm not his enemy

12
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,934
I'm his daughter

13
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,005
Then why do you
fight with Dad?

14
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,210
I'm going to Dad

15
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,213
Dad's in the hospital.

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,349
Then I'm going to Mom.

17
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,552
You can't do that, Shota!
You have a fever

18
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,754
Come back

19
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,298
What are you doing
down here, Shota?

20
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,033
You need to be back
in bed upstairs

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,002
He wants to stay by Mom.

22
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,512
Put your head
down slowly.

23
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,554
Are you in pain?

24
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,255
A little

25
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,226
Can you stand it?

26
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,096
If you can't stand it,
call me right away

27
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,499
Don't hold back

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,467
Don't force yourself. If I
have to, I'll carry you to

29
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,902
the hospital

30
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,738
It's ready

31
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,274
What did you make?

32
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,276
Special cold medicine

33
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,712
OK, ready to try it, Shota?

34
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,584
I won't drink
your medicine

35
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,389
He thinks she's
an enemy

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,759
Because she doesn't
get along with Dad

37
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,395
It seems that way.

38
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,598
fiU^^SXlij
sn ht?

39
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:58,203
But Shota, my medicine is
also Mom's medicine

40
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,673
What do you mean?

41
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,044
I learned how to make it
from Mom over there..

42
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,614
She used to make it for me
when I got sick

43
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,781
when I was little.

44
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,250
You made it for me, too,
didn't you, Mom?

45
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,017
You made it for me, too,
didn't you, Mom?

46
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,287
Can I taste that?

47
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,325
I recognize this scent

48
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,827
It has ginger in it,
right?

49
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,162
Mom made it for me before

50
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,934
You're right, I remember
having this too

51
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,470
Shota, this is Mom's medicine!

52
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,278
You finally felt like
tasting it, huh?

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,714
Just try and
taste one mouthful

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,726
It's Mom's flavor.

55
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,094
She was a really
nice mom.

56
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,298
I'm sure she was to you all too

57
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,801
She was nice

58
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,570
When Dad got made at us, 
she'd comfort us

59
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,639


60
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,775
Hitomi, did you know her?

61
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,347
She came to see me once
in Sapporo 

62
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,818
I've seen Mom
crying

63
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,787
Me, too.

64
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,723
Where?

65
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,791
In the kitchen..

66
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,361
When I came home in the
evening, she was

67
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,396
crying in the kitchen.

68
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,433
Was it because Aunty and
Dad didn't get along?

69
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,572
She might have wanted
to see Hitomi.

70
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,112
Mom...

71
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,715
I'm sorry

72
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,519
I feel really bad about Mom.

73
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,924
It's the only
thing I regret

74
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,133
It's OK... what is it?

75
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,606
Why did you and Dad fight?

76
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,085
Hitomi's dad asked Dad to
sell this house and

77
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,955
lend him the money.

78
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,427
Dad thought that was outrageous
and got angry.

79
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,196
What did you do?

80
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:17,769
I was his wife, so I asked
Dad to lend us the money

81
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,907
But wasn't that
in the past?

82
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,211
That was when Hitomi
was three years old

83
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,380
But Dad hasn't gotten
over his feelings

84
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,750
from the past

85
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,958
You all better go to bed
It's late

86
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,328
Ok, Goodnight.

87
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,872
Good night.

88
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,940
Ah, Aunty.

89
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,976
Thank you for making the
ginger medicine or Shota

90
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,212
Good night.

91
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,289
Hitomi, you go
to bed, too

92
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,724
I'll watch over Shota

93
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,137
Mom...

94
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,599
The next morning..

95
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,301
Are you awake, Shota?

96
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,572
I'm awake.

97
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,307
You are?

98
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,944
Your fever went down!

99
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,980
Your fever went
down, Shota

100
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,315
His fever went down.

101
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,250
The ginger medicine
worked

102
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,451
It went down?

103
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,220
You're right
It did!

104
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,458
Thank you, Aunty

105
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,729
Where are you
going, Shota?

106
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,297
To tell Akira.

107
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,466
He's still sleeping

108
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,937
What a relief

109
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,807
I'm going to sleep
for a while

110
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,676
That kid was pretty heavy

111
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:16,514
Mom

112
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,861
Thank you, Grandma

113
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,666
Momoko made hot
ginger medicine?

114
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,636
At first Shota didn't
want to drink it, but

115
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,571
after taking one sip
he said, "It's got

116
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,907
Mom's flavor" and he drank
the whole thing

117
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,979
By morning, his fever had
gone down completely

118
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,815
Grandma's hot ginger medicine really
amazing, isn't it?

119
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,183
And so is Mom, too

120
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:38,129
It's not that Momoko's
so great...

121
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,198
It's the hot ginger

122
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,635
There you go again.
saying spiteful things.

123
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,537
Oh yeah, I brought
you something.

124
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,506
What is it?

125
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,008
Tsukuda Dance music

126
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,609
The festival is already
next week

127
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,078
Even though you'll be here
at least you can hear

128
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,279
the music

129
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,780


130
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,815
Here's the player

131
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,083
Hitomi, will you put it 
over there

132
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,051
Thank you

133
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,786

134
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,356
Thanks. Do you know
how to put this in?

135
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,458
Of course

136
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,195
It's too bad, isn't it
Grandpa

137
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,963
Given how much you
love the festival

138
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,265
It's just a minor
festival this year

139
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,234
If it were next year's
real festival, and I

140
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,069
was laid up like this,
I would have to go

141
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,504
even with this leg

142
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,307
Good thing
you broke it this year

143
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,943
I don't think there's a
good or a bad time

144
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,911
for breaking a bone

145
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,782
I brought something, too

146
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,584
This photo.

147
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,621
I made a copy for you ...

148
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,124
Grandma and the kids.

149
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,459
You can look at it when
you're feeling lonely

150
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,660
Thank you

151
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,163


152
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,532
OK, time to head home
Take care of yourself

153
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,901
Thanks so much for the visit

154
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,436
You understand, right?
Just push the button

155
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,470
Just push it, OK

156
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,805


157
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,573
Don't listen to it

158
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,475
Thank you

159
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,043
Great, is it this?

160
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,483
This is it

161
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,652
This is it

162
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,266
Setsuko...Momoko made
the hot ginger medicine

163
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,902
you taught her to make.

164
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:34,879
Momoko did.

165
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,874
The regular town..

166
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,648
turned into a
festival town

167
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,822
It's a minor festival before
the real Tsukuda Festival.

168
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,894
It's the middle of summer
in Tsukishima

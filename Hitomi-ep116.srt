Music by
YAMASHITA KosuKe

4
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,105
You did it!

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,474
So ROSE MARY is going
to make their debut

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,177
We did it!

7
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,311
You did it!

8
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,546
We did it!

9
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,880
Congratulations!

10
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,981
Thank you!

11
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,149
Congratulations!

12
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,083
Thank you!

13
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,685
Can this really
be happening?

14
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,853
Yes it can!

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,824
Wait! It's not what
you think

16
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,559
What do you mean?

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,426
What is it?

18
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,964
They're going to make
their debut, but

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,735
though Yuka and Junko
were scouted

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,505
you weren't included,
Hitomi

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,079
The're forming a live-dancer
unit, and two of them will

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,548
be Yuka and Junko

23
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,886



24
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,725
This happens ail the time

25
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:11,597
When only several members
of a group are chosen

26
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,099
it has to do with image
and character, and

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,069
things like that

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,479
That means those two
had ability, doesn't it?

29
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,082
That's great..

30
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,885
Shall we celebrate?

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,987
I'll call there now, and treat
you all to "monja'

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,756
Its too early
to celebrate

33
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,491
What do you mean?

34
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,959
They both plan to
turn it down

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,161
Why?

36
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,530
They don't want to do
it without you.

37
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,485
Hitomi

38
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,819
It's been a while

39
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,730
Moe told me

40
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,733
I'm sorry you're holding
back because of me

41
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,902
It's not that.

42
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,040
The dance was made for
the three of us

43
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,476
That's why we don't want
to do it without you.

44
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,113
But Junko

45
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,817
You always said you wanted
to make a major debut

46
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,120
It was your dream.

47
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,989
Wasn't that your goal?

48
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,893
And it's your chance,
too, Yuka

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,129
It's your chance for everyone
in Japan to see you dance.

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,268
You both have the
ability.

51
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,372
The ability to dance on
stage professionally

52
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,908
It would be a waste for
you to turn down.

53
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:13,685
Up to now, my goal was to
go to Dance Beat, right?

54
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:22,427
My dream was to go to Dance
Beat with the three of you.

55
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:31,737
That's why I really,
really enjoyed it..

56
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:37,576
It was totally fulfilling, and
I had the greatest time

57
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,783
So when it was over, I didn't
have any regrets

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,959
But it shouldn't be

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,531
We all have a long
future ahead of us

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,270
When I heard about you two,
it made me realize that

61
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,841
I need to start
something new

62
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:17,015
It's only natural, but

63
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:23,355
I fee! like it's telling me
to start something.

64
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:29,928
So while your debut is a chance
for both of you, it's also

65
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,166
a big chance for me to
take a step forward.

66
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:49,414
Your debut is something
that I'm proud of, too

67
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,954
So...I want you
two to debut

68
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,794
All right

69
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,608
The other day I ate together
with my father and mother

70
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,543
for the first time
in a long time.

71
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,411


72
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,814
It wasn't too bad.

73
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,890
What about you, Junko?
How are your parents?

74
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,761
I'm sorry I made you all worry.
They're fine now.

75
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,563
Are you going to tell your
father about your debut?

76
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,566
Actually, I already
told them about it

77
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,269
And?

78
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,372
? actual*!
I for it

79
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,609
He's really something
else, isn't he!

80
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,278
He is, isn't he?

81
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,050
So no more obstacles
in the way of your debut

82
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,489
Let's make another toast!

83
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,158
We just made one

84
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,759
iA/hoc rfes9 It's something
to celebrate, so we'll

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
make as many toasts
as we want

86
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,761
Stand up

87
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,996
You want us
to stand?

88
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,397
Don't worry

89
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,466
Ready?

90
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,305
Here's to Yuka's an Junko's
shining future

91
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,107


92
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,077
Here's to Hitomi's and Moe's
unlimited possibilities

93
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,548


94
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,121
Monji is sweet
youth, isn't it?

95
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,191
It is..

96
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,336
I'll see you.

97
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,271
Let's all do our best

98
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,808
We should get together like
this once in a while

99
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,410
Yes, let's!

100
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,545
Let's get together again

101
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,241
See you!

102
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,185
Take care

103
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,656
You, too!

104
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,552
I'm glad for Yuka
and Junko.

105
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,854
I'm glad, too

106
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,822
I want them both to
do their best

107
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:20,759
I'm full!

108
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,259
I'm full!

109
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,094
Thank you for the meal.

110
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,529
Are you done already?

111
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,364
I ate "monja,' o evfcn
if tried Uo

112
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,033
eat too much..

113
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,535
I'll givel i^sei to
the two of you

114
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,703
Are you sure?

115
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,938
Go right ahead

116
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,873
Thank you.

117
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,505
Ray!

118
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,046
We were talking about
what we should do after

119
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,816
Dance Beat was over,
I never expected him to

120
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,484
be selling dried bonito

121
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:20,919
I was shocked

122
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,220
I was shocked

123
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,457
But it's
good for KEN

124
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:26,992
It's just like him.

125
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,527
When we re dancing, rather
than think about our moves,

126
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,129
he moves with his
body first

127
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,399
What are you going
to do now?

128
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,503
I've been thinking about
several different things,

129
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:42,173
but what are you
going to do?

130
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,679
I heard about Yuka
and Junko

131
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,017
How do you feel about them
making their debut?

132
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,086
I'm really happy.

133
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,456
After all, we were
a team..

134
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,332
But it made me think that
maybe I didn't have the

135
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,803
ability or that I was
lacking somehow

136
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,577
It's not just Yuka and
Junko.. everyone

137
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:26,551
around me seems to be
moving forward..

138
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,454
I feel like I'm being
left behind.

139
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,158
Better not to rush
to an answer

140
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,928
You have your own style
of dancing, don't you?

141
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,768
Why don't you take a good
look at your dancing again

142
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,205
I will

143
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,007
Hitomi!

144
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,077
Hello Ray

145
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,480
Our cherry blossom viewing
party will be tomorrow

146
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,182
It looks like the cherry blossoms
won't fast much longer

147
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,149
All right

148
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,784
If you want to,
please join us.

149
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,885



150
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,253
Please do

151
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,354
OK I'll come

152
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,157


153
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,193
Let's a ty!

154
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,461
Th

155
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,932
Flower-viewing. This will
be my first time

156
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,238
Come to think of it, Hitomi
didn't come for our flower

157
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,673
viewing party last
year, did she?

158
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,174
That's right

159
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,809
Katsu was so angry!

160
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,644
He kept calling your
cell phone

161
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,614
All I got was your
voice mail

162
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,483
You were dancing,
weren't you?

163
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,152
Dancing?

164
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,820
It aswi tfen
OCK6

165
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,057
The time when you and Ken
^Ja e dance floor.

166
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,925
^atlime^

167
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,562
It made me realize how
awesome dancing was.

168
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,165
It was good for you,
wasn't it, Hitomi?

169
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,936
It's like you met your
life mentors

170
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,440
That's so true.

171
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,309

173
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,855
Isn't it supposed
to be a cat?

184
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,282
Do you like this
kind of thing?

185
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,483
I enjoy it

186
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,885
Shall I have
more to drink?

187
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,620
Go right ahead

188
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,022
Dad.51?

189
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,157
Try to keep,
Yujiro.

190
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,625
I have to work tomorrow

191
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,394
I'm thirsty

192
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,429
That's enough.

193
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,864
There's more to it.

194
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,465
You've had enough

195
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,201
I'm not the eyebrow type

196
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,072
Ken! Ray!

197
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,041
Can you dance the
Mayuge Neko?

198
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,776
No, I can't

199
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,377
I'll teach you.

200
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,046
OK, I'll try

201
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:08,713
OK, I'll try

202
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:08,980
OK, I'll try

203
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,981
Me, too

204
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,891
First, start with the
mayuge neko pose

205
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,862
What shall I do?

206
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,831
Nice, isn't it?

207
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,035
You look cute, Ray!

208
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,804
You're doing great,
Suzuki!

209
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,913
It was an enjoyable
flower viewing party.

210
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,149
But Hitomi still didn't
know what her next

211
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,253

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,474
So ROSE MARY is goifig*

6
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,177
We did it'

7
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,311
You did it'

8
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,546
We did it!

9
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,880

10
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,981
Thank you!

11
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,149
Congratulations

12
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,083
Thank you1

13
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,685
Can this really
be happening9

14
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,853
Yes it can

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,824
Wait! It s not what
you think

16
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,559
What do you meSm?

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,426
What is it9

18
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,964
They'rfe gbing to make '
their debut, but.

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,735
it was Yuka and Junko
who were scouted

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,505
You weren't ihciuded,

i omi

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,079
The/ re forming a live-dancer
u it, and two of them will

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,548
be Yuka a d Junko

23
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,886



24
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,725
This happens ail the time

25
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:11,597
When only several members
of a group are chosen

26
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,099
it has to do with image
and character, and

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,069
things like that

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,479
t That means that h
two had ability/io^sn t it7

29
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,082
That's great..

30
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,885
Shall we celebrate?

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,987
411 call therwftow, and treat
you all to "monja '

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,756
Its tod^early
to celebrate

33
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,491
What do you mean9

34
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,959
They both plan to
turn it down

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,161
Why?

36
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,530
They don't want to do
it without you.

37
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,485
Hitomi

38
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,819
ItVs been a while

39
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,730
-Moe fold me

40
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,733
I'm sorry you're holding
bal<t>ecausepf me

41
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,902
IF's riot that.

42
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,040
The dance^vas made for
the three of us

43
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,476
That's^Why we don't want
to do it with tftYOU.

44
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,113
But,'bunko

45
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,817
You always said you wanted
to make a major debut

46
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,120
It was your cPream.

47
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,989
WasrV that y t!r goal9

48
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,893
And it's your chance,
too, Yuka

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,129
It's your chance for everyone
in Japan to see*you dance.

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,268
You both have the
ability.

51
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,372
The ability to dance on
stage professionally

52
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,908
It would be a waste for
you to turn itaown.

53
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:13,685
Up until now, my goal was toJT
g 1 pn ance eat, wasn't it?

54
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:22,427
y drpam as o go to D lice
Beat /ith he threeof you.

55
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:31,737
That's why 1 really,
really enjoyed it..

56
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:37,576
nas totally fulfilling, and
had fhe greatest time

57
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,783
So when it was over, I didn't

Aiee any . ing e se

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,959
B *t it shouldn't b6

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,531
We all have a long
future aheSd 6f us

60
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,270
When I heard about you Jwo,
it made me realize that

61
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,841
I need to start
something new

62
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:17,015
It's only natural, but

63
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:23,355
I fee! like it's telling mej
to start something.

64
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:29,928
So w He your debOt Js a chance
for both of you, it's also

65
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,166
a big chance foY;me to
take a step forward.

66
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:49,414

Dance Beat was over,
I never expected him to

00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,332
But it made me think that
maybe I didn't have the

00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,803
ability or that I was
lacking somehow

136
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,577

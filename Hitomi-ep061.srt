What's wrong, Katsu?

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,299
You've been putting that
same shirt on and taking

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
off so many times.

21
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,179
I don't seem to have
much energy..

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,513
I wonder if it's the
summer doldrums.

What are you saying?

00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,057

Something fell down...

32
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,835
Katsu!

33
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,672
Katsu... Are you OK?

34
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,136
What's wrong, Ume?

00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,137
It's Katsu!

36
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,472
He fell down

37
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,185
Are you okay, Katsu?

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,270

Don't move me!
It hurts!

40
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,698
Grandpa fell down
the stairs?

41
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,744
Makoto went with him
in an ambulance

42
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,622
me and I will stay here,
so go straight to the

43
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,249
hospital, Hitomi.

44
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,001
The hospital is

45
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,505
Did he hit his head?

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,839
I don't know anything.

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,591
You'd better go!
We'll be fine

48
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,842
I'm sorry!

49
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,969
Call Momoko

50
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,512
That's right

51
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,763
Shall I call Keiko?

52
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,181
Could you?

53
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,474
What about the children?

54
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,142
Akira's at tutorial
school and

55
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,228
Shota and Yuria are..

56
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,479
at the pool

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,398
I'll go to Tsukishima

58
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,026
Take care of the
shop, Yuzo

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,361
Okay

60
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,364
I hope he didn't land
the wrong way

Katsutaro broke
his left knee

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,292
They're examining him now
to see if there isn't

64
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,294
anything else wrong.

65
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,812
Hitomi?

66
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,273
This is Ippongi's
ce11 phone...

67
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,567
I'm unable to come to
the phonee right now...

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,486
Please leave a message at
the sound of the tone

69
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,614
Haven't you been able
to reach Momoko yet?

70
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,367
No matter how many times
I call, it goes

71
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,869
to her voicemail

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,621
What's she doing at
a time like this?

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,957
It can't be helped
She's working

74
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,254
At that time,
Momoko was.

75
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,804
Here's a cold
drink for you.

76
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,556
Thank you.

77
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,932
Your daughter
just called.

78
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,018
What did she want**

79
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,354
She said she left a message
on your voicemail

80
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,938
I set-...

81
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,607
haven't listened
to my messages

82
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,908
Ms Ippongi...

83
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,494
How did it go?

84
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,249
You could At get the
dep Wmeril store..

85
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,628
They have enough with
the brands they're

handling n "to, so-they
don't have any room

87
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,590

It's really tough here
in Tokyo, isn't it?

91
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,518
Isn't there a place
for us here?

92
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,564

That's right.

96
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,410
I feel really bad about
leaving everything to

97
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,662
you because I have to go
back and forth between

98
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,622
here and the main office

99
00:06:55,623 --> 00:07:00,252

100
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,380
I'm sorry

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,386
The manager's so
sarcastic

102
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,596
He doesn't do
anything.

103
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,392
It can't be helped
t'stlo our best

104

Isn't the k an
extra zero 7

108
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,350
I wonder what happened?

109
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,062
He uses those stairs
everyday, so how

110
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,856
could he fall down?

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,484
Will Dad be okay?

112
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,821
He'll be fine. The doctor
is with him now

113
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,449
£ a broken bone,
fietffce okay.

114
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,159
One of the members of
the judo team had a

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,661
broken bone, and it
healed in a month.

116
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,538
Maybe it was the
summer doldrums.

117
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,541
Ume said that he wasn't
feeling well since

118
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,460
opening the store

119
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,128
i won e f he slipped

120
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,172
The fatigue just caught
up with him..

121
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,090
He's been working extra
hard for the past six

122
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,092
months since Setsuko died

123
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,599
What are we going to do if
something happens to Grandpa?

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,767
Don't say that.

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,686
Ms. Ippongi?

126
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,480
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,564
We've finished
all the tests

128
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,649
How is he?

129
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,359
Fortunately there weren't
any abnormalities in the

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,902
brain waves and

131
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,529

Aren't you glad?

146
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,109
After taking Katsutaro's physical
condition into consideration,

147
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,486
they decided to wait a few days
to do the surgery.

148
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,407
Including the physical
therapy, he'll be in

Talk it over with
Mr Wakayama and

190
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,276
the child care counseling
center, and figure out

191

some way to handle it

192
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:45,328
We could have someone
else take them in...

We have to think what's

Even if it is just for a

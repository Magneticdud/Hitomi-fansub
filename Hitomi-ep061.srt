CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 61

2
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,468
July, 2007

3
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,719
It's summertime.

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,106
It's HOT

5
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,983
Really hot

6
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,569
HOT!

7
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,239
It's TOO HOT

8
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,117
Why is summer in Tokyo this hot?

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,955
Stop saying it's
hot already!

10
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,291
It makes it even hotter!

11
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,128
Be quiet! You're making
it even more oppressive

12
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,921
Oppressive! Me?

13
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,556
Look forward to this...

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,682
Go ahead, Shosuke

15
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,812
It's on the house!

16
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,274
Wait a minute!

17
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,943
Up to 2 per person

18
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,213
What's wrong, Katsu?

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,299
You've been putting that
same shirt on and taking

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
it off so many times.

21
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,179
I don't seem to have
much energy..

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,513
I wonder if it's the
summer doldrums.

23
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,723
What are you saying?

24
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,057
Summer is just 
getting started!

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,559
It's especially
hot today

26
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,104
I'll bring down more summer
things from upstairs

27
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,191
I have a feeling summer
things will sell today

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,984
Keep an eye on the
store for me

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,699
It's true, it got hot

30
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,492
It's really summer

31
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,831
Something fell down...

32
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,835
Katsu!

33
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,672
Katsu... Are you OK?

34
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,136
What's wrong, Ume?

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,137
It's Katsu!

36
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,472
He fell down!

37
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,185
Are you okay, Katsu?

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,270
That hurts! It hurts!

39
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,191
Don't move me!
It hurts!

40
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,698
Grandpa fell down
the stairs?

41
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,744
Makoto went with him
in an ambulance

42
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,622
Ume and I will stay here,
so go straight to the

43
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,249
hospital, Hitomi.

44
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,001
The hospital is..

45
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,505
Did he hit his head?

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,839
I don't know anything.

47
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,591
You'd better go!
We'll be fine

48
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:20,842
I'm sorry!

49
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,969
Call Momoko

50
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,512
That's right

51
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,763
Shall I call Keiko?

52
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,181
Could you?

53
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,474
What about the children?

54
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,142
Akira's at tutorial
school and

55
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,228
Shota and Yuria are..

56
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,479
at the pool

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,398
I'll go to Tsukishima

58
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,026
Take care of the
shop, Yuzo

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,361
Okay

60
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,364
I hope he didn't land
the wrong way

61
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,909
Medical Center
Outpatient Department

62
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,246
Katsutaro broke
his left knee

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,292
They're examining him now
to see if there isn't

64
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,294
anything else wrong.

65
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,812
Mom?

66
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,273
This is Ippongi's
cell phone...

67
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,567
I'm unable to come to
the phonee right now...

68
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,486
Please leave a message at
the sound of the tone

69
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,614
Haven't you been able
to reach Momoko yet?

70
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,367
No matter how many times
I call, it goes

71
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,869
to her voicemail

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,621
What's she doing at
a time like this?

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,957
It can't be helped
She's working

74
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,254
At that moment,
Momoko was:

75
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,804
Here's a cold
drink for you.

76
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,556
Thank you.

77
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,932
Your daughter
just called.

78
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,018
What did she say?

79
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,354
She said she left a message
on your voicemail

80
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,938
I still

81
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,607
haven't listened
to my messages

82
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,908
Ms Ippongi...

83
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,494
How did it go?

84
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,249
You couldn't get the
department store..

85
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,628
Their hands are full with
the brands they

86
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,421
carry now, so they
don't have any room

87
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,590
for our line of cosmetics.

88
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,343
I really tried to get
them to agree

89
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,346
I really thought
we'd get it.

90
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,516
It's really tough here
in Tokyo, isn't it?

91
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,518
Isn't there a place
for us here?

92
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,564
Ms. Ippongi!

93
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,361
It's still only 5%
of the expectations

94
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,571
of opening up this
new market.

95
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,824
That's right.

96
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,410
I feel really bad about
leaving everything to

97
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,662
you because I have to go
back and forth between

98
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,622
here and the main office

99
00:06:55,623 --> 00:07:00,252
But after two months, the
numbers are like this.

100
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,380
I'm sorry

101
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,386
The manager's so
sarcastic

102
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,596
He doesn't do
anything.

103
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,392
It can't be helped
Let's do our best

104
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,703
Do our best...

105
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,129
Ms Ippongi

106
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,591
This number here..

107
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,759
Isn't it missing
a zero?

108
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,350
I wonder what happened?

109
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,062
He uses those stairs
everyday, so how

110
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,856
could he fall down?

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,484
Will Dad be okay?

112
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,821
He'll be fine. The doctor
is with him now

113
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,449
It's just a broken bone,
so he'll be okay.

114
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,159
One of the members of
the judo team had a

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,661
broken bone, and it
healed in a month.

116
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,538
Maybe it was the
summer doldrums.

117
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,541
Ume said that he wasn't
feeling well since

118
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,460
opening the store

119
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,128
I wonder if he slipped

120
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,172
The fatigue just caught
up with him..

121
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,090
He's been working extra
hard for the past six

122
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,092
months since Setsuko died

123
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,599
What are we going to do if
something happens to Grandpa?

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,767
Don't say that.

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,686
Ms. Ippongi?

126
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,480
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,564
We've finished
all the tests

128
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,649
How is he?

129
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,359
Fortunately there weren't
any abnormalities in the

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,902
brain waves.

131
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,529
He'll have to have surgery
for the broken bone,

132
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,865
but it's not urgent, and
it won't be a

133
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,992
difficult surgery

134
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,495
And of course there won't
be any after-effects

135
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,330
So he can continue
as before

136
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,457
Once his bone has healed,

137
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,543
he'll be good as ever.

138
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,003
But he'll need a little bit
of physical therapy

139
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,172
Thank you.

140
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,716
Banzai!

141
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,636
Everyone... Please
keep the noise down.

142
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:15,845


143
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,305
We have to prepare his
hospital room, so

144
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,057
please wait here.

145
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,312
Aren't you glad?

146
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,109
After taking Katsutaro's physical
condition into consideration,

147
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,486
they decided to wait a few days
to do the surgery.

148
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,407
Including the physical
therapy, he'll be in

149
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,367
the hospital for
about a month.

150
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,251
Dad!

151
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,712
Grandpa!

152
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,798
It's good it's just a broken bone

153
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,758
Are you OK? 
Does it hurt?

154
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,927
No... he gave me
pain killers.

155
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,887
It's good you
didn't hit your head!

156
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,348
That's because your way
of falling was skillful

157
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,225

158
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,727
What about the others?

159
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,228
Yuzo contacted them,
and they'll all be 

160
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,771
waiting at your house

161
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,106
I just haven't made

162
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,233
contact with Mom    

163
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,485
Well, no need for Momoko

164
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,988
Mr Ippongi, you have a visitor

165
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,574
A Mr Wakayama from the
Counseling Center

166
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,575
Please show him in

167
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,035
Hitomi

168
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,747
Did you call him?

169
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,499
I thought it was better
to report it to them

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,418
b^ Umjiiiftil if***

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,212
I'll go ahead, and fill everyone in

172
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,630
Thank you

173
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,008
I'll take the children

174
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,843
to get some juice

175
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,345
You must be thirsty

176
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,679
from being worried

177
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,264
Thanks

178
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,017
I'll treat you

179
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,269
He's going to
treat them.

180
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,107
What a time for
this to happen.

181
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,952
When I fell down the
stairs, the first

182
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,789
thing I thought about
was the children.

183
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,334
What's going to happen
to the children

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,463
if something happens to me?

185
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,383
I thought about it the whole time

186
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,802
they were examining me

187
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:26,351
Hitomi.. What are you going
while I'm in the hospital?

188
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,064
I don't want you to over do
it, and get sick again.

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,149
Talk it over with
Mr Wakayama and

190
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,276
the child care counseling
center, and figure out

191
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,320
some other way to handle it

192
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:45,328
We could have someone
else take them in...

193
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,666
Actually, as soon as we
got the phone call,

194
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,918
we talked it over

195
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,839
If you were going to be
in the hospital for an

196
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,882
extended period of time,
we would have to use

197
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,468
other alternatives,
but since it's

198
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,054
only a month

199
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,515
We want make a decision
after consulting

200
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,308
with the two of you.

201
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,021
We have to think what's
best for the children.

202
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,524
Even if it is just for a
short period of time

203
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,318
a change in the home environment
isn't very good for them

204
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,404
I'll do it. I understand

205
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,576
your concern, Grandpa, but it's fine!

206
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,121
The children have been
helping out a lot lately

207
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,415
That's true.

208
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,292
Then, please do.

209
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,836
Hitomi!

210
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,255
We're counting on
you, too

211
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,592
You can show us your skills

212
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,719
Let's do our best!

213
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,054
I'm really counting
on you

214
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,727
Fix your leg first

215
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,153
Hitomi..

216
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,155
Please don't forget...

217
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,324
You're not alone in this

218
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,910
Don't over do it, and if

219
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,247
you have a question or a concern

220
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,833
Please consult us right away.
Come crying to us anytime!

221
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,211
I'll come crying to you.

222
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,588
Don't try TOO hard, OK?

223
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,009
I'll do my best not to
try too hard!

224
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,887
Thank you

225
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,528
Is Katsu okay?

226
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,697
He'll be healed
in about a month

227
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,115
I'm sorry to worry you

228
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,617
I'm so glad.

229
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,961
What's wrong, Hitomi?

230
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,756
I'm starting to feel
worried

231
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,094
Will we be OK
for a month?

232
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,850
You're back, we've been waiting

233
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,768
How's Katsu?

234
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,936
How's Katsu?

235
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,272
Other than his knee, he's
in good form

236
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,731
He is?

237
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,899
I'm glad

238
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,694
I'm telling you, he's tough!

239
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,865
Everything will be OK

240
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,576
You have all of us here.

241
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,078
While Katsu is gone

242
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,454
We'll get through this together

243
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,124
Okay

244
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,639
The Ippongi family's summer
without Katsutaro is

245
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,807
about to begin

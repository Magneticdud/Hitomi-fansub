2
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,606
Thisls my only father.

3
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,778
The father who abandoned
me never existed

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,816
A father like that
isn't a father

5
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,686
Wait, Akira!

6
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,154
Akira!

7
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,656
Come back, Akira!

8
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,658
Akira! Akira!

00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,163
What happened?

10
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,765
Sorry about the
commotion.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,267
Akira's hurting

12
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,072
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt

13
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,177
Akira!

14
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,162
I'm in better shape
than yoCTare

15
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,942
Grandpa told me

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,011
about your father

17
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,018
It was the first time
I ever went to an

18
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,586
amusement park

19
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,426
When he told me to
wait for him, and

20
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:47,499
sat me down on the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel,

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,238
it was fun at the beginning
because I had ice cream.

22
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:03,815
But even after I finished II
of it, he didn't come ba M.

23
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,935
Get up

24
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,472
You're heavy!

25
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,823
I think.

26
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,357

27
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,258

28
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,895
I Jciftj of understand
"how Naoko feels

29
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,599
About what?

30
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,740
Wh shejftent to the amusement
park,*and sat on the bench

31
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:11,550
She Ranted to feel what
you felt at that time.

32
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,690
Especially if she
cares about you

33
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,932
Iwa loriiy, too.

34
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,673
It's not even close to
what you felt, but.

35
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,909
idn't have a fat ie 1
from the time 4 as

37
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,517
There were a lot of times
when I hated my father

38
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,590
But whenever! f&t ike
tha ^ v/o" Id think...

39
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,395
If it weren* for him, uid

48
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,133
For an hour after that, they

in this world, it made foe
so h&ppy, I could ry

But.

114
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,456
That's not true.

115
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,361
Vou have another «athei\..

Like this poem...

121
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:00,585
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you..

122
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:06,157
And ant to become
in erson who can

123
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,995
understand those reasons

124
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,503
That's all I wanted to s&y

125
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,531
That night, Katsutaro looked

he feels that they are
raising him, too.

129
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,480
Akira wrote a letter of
~a "blogy to Naoko...

130
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,419
And he hopes that someday
he me 1 his father

at the amep ate ith I
the different last<r>ames.

CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 48

2
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,606
This is my only father.

3
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,778
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,816
A father like that
isn't a father.

5
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,686
Wait, Akira!

6
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,154
Akira!

7
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,656
Come back, Akira!

8
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,658
Akira! Akira!

9
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,163
What happened?

10
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,765
Sorry about the
commotion...

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,267
Akira's hurting..

12
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,072
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt...

13
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,177
Akira!

14
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,162
I'm in better shape
than you are.

15
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,942
Grandpa told me...

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,011
...about your father.

17
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,018
It was the first time
I ever went to an

18
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,586
amusement park.

19
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,426
When he told me to
wait for him, and

20
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:47,499
sat me down on the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel,

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,238
it was fun at the beginning
because I had ice cream...

22
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:03,815
But even after I finished aII
of it, he didn't come back.

23
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,935
Get up.

24
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,472
You're heavy!

25
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,823
I think...

26
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,895
I kind of understand
how Naoko feels.

27
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,599
About what?

28
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,740
Why she went to the amusement
park, and sat on the bench.

29
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:11,550
She wanted to feel what
you felt at that time.

30
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,690
Especially if she
cares about you.

31
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,932
I was lonely, too.

32
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,673
It's not even close to
what you felt, but...

33
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,909
I didn't have a father
from the time I was

34
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,878
in the third grade...

35
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,517
There were a lot of times
when I hated my father.

36
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,590
But whenever I felt like
that, I would think...

37
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,395
If it weren't for him, I would
never have been born.

38
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,999
That's how I've come
to think about him.

39
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,776
Let's go home.

40
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,978
Everyone's waiting.

41
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,314
I don't want to.

42
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,951
I see...

43
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,522
I'll wait until you
change your mind.

44
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,091
Don't lie.

45
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,959
I'm not lying.

46
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,133
For an hour after that, they
didn't say anything.

47
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,504
Hitomi?

48
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,807
Did you fall asleep?

49
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,077
I'm awake.

50
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,487
Your stomach's telling
you to go home.

51
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,727
We have your favorite...
croquettes.

52
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,835
Let's go home.

53
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,848
We're home!

54
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,121
Akira...

55
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,722
I'm home.

56
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,725
You haven't eaten yet?

57
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,764
Yuria and Shota refused to
eat until Akira came home.

58
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,905
Akira...

59
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,408
I asked Naoko to go home.

60
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,177
Yuzo took her home.

61
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,917
Naoko just sat there, and
she didn't stop crying.

62
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,854
So when you see her in school,
you should apologize.

63
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,029
I'm sorry, Dad.

64
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,071
I'm sorry, Yuria and Shota.

65
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,308
I didn't mean to
shock you...

66
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,312
They were just a little bit shocked...

67
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,014
They're ok.

68
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,916
Shall we eat?

69
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,151
Let's wash our hands.

70
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,295
Time for dinner!

71
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,667
After dinner...

72
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,575
This is...

73
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:02,214
...a notebook, your mom and I
started when we took Keiko in

74
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:06,852
as a foster child... It's full
of things we learned.

75
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,691
They taught us a poem at the
foster parents' meeting...

76
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,296
It's such a nice poem...
Do you mind if I read it?

77
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:33,245
"There once were two women
who never knew each other..."

78
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,618
"You don't remember
one of them..."

79
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,555
You call the other
one, Mother"

80
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:50,962
"These two women are tied
to you and how you are"

81
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,532
"in a way that no one
else knows about."

82
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:58,169
"One watches over you
like the stars above..."

83
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,342
"The other one wraps you
in warmth like the sun..."

84
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:09,381
"One nurtured you inside her,
and gave birth to you..."

85
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:14,452
"The other one lived
her life with you."

86
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:19,157
"One gave you the strength
to go in search of love..."

87
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:24,429
"The other one loves you
no matter what happens."

88
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,266
"One made you a citizen
of your country..."

89
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,904
"The other one gave
you a name."

90
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,908
"One gave you the talent
you were born with..."

91
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:43,815
The other one nurtured that
talent, and gave you a dream."

92
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:49,020
"One gave you the power to
feel happiness and sadness..."

93
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,691
"The other one made you
feel safe when you were

94
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,527
filled with doubts."

95
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,164
"One always remembers your
cute smile when you were a

96
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:07,105
newborn baby... The other one
encompassed your sadness."

97
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:13,278
"One parted with you...
For your sake, out of

98
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,684
love for you. The other
one wanted to meet you

99
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,688
so badly, she prayed with
all her heart, and the gods

100
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,392
brought you two together
without hesitation."

101
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:32,263
"And now when you ask the
question that's been

102
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,834
bothering you all this
time, with tears in

103
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:44,743
your eyes, Which
is my real mother?"

104
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:52,550
"My dear child... They
are both your mother."

105
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,955
"You were blessed with
all kinds of love

106
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,658
from both your mothers."

107
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,662
That's the poem.

108
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,367
Akira...

109
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:15,974
When you said that I was
the only father you had

110
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:24,115
in this world, it made me
so happy, I could cry.

111
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,486
But...

112
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,456
That's not true...

113
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,361
You have another father
The one who brought you

114
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,663
into this world.

115
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,568
You mustn't forget
your father.

116
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,507
If it weren't for your
father, you and I would

117
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,343
never have met.

118
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,446
Like this poem...

119
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:00,585
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you..

120
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:06,157
And I want you to become
a kind person who can

121
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,995
understand those reasons.

122
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,503
That's all I wanted to say.

123
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,531
That night, Katsutaro looked
through the photo albums

124
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,299
by himself...

125
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,545
Although he is supposed to
be raising the children,

126
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,048
he feels that they are
raising him, too.

127
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,480
Akira wrote a letter of
apology to Naoko...

128
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,419
And he hopes that someday
he can meet his father

129
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,688
again with kindness
in his heart.

130
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,660
Hitomi went out in the
alleyway, and looked

131
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,164
at the nameplate with alI
the different last names.

132
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,601
And she wondered how much
of the children's happiness

133
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,672
and sadness she would
be able to understand.

134
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,950
The May winds blew a
variety of emotions

135
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,320
through the alleyways
of Tsukishima.

136
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,996
Hitomi learned something
new again...

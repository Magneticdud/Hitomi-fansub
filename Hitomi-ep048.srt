CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 48

2
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,255
This is my only father.

3
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,420
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

4
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:23,464
A father like that
isn't a father.

5
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,580
Wait, Akira!

6
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,020
Akira!

7
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,306
Akira! Akira!

8
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,220
What happened?

9
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,410
Sorry about the
commotion...

10
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,915
Akira's hurting..

11
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,720
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt...

12
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,824
Akira!

13
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,842
I'm in better shape
than you are.

14
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,622
Grandpa told me...

15
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:25,691
...about your father.

16
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,664
It was the first time
I ever went to an

17
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:34,232
amusement park.

18
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:41,072
When he told me to
wait for him, and

19
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:47,145
sat me down on the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel,

20
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:52,883
it was fun at the beginning
because I had ice cream...

21
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:03,460
But even after I finished aII
of it, he didn't come back.

22
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,612
Get up.

23
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,150
You're heavy!

24
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,500
I think...

25
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:49,572
I kind of understand
how Naoko feels.

26
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:53,242
About what?

27
00:03:55,711 --> 00:04:01,416
Why she went to the amusement
park, and sat on the bench.

28
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:11,226
She wanted to feel what
you felt at that time.

29
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,366
Especially if she
cares about you.

30
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,607
I was lonely, too.

31
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,348
It's not even close to
what you felt, but...

32
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:37,551
I didn't have a father
from the time I was

33
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,520
in the third grade...

34
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:45,192
There were a lot of times
when I hated my father.

35
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:51,264
But whenever I felt like
that, I would think...

36
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:56,069
If it weren't for him, I would
never have been born.

37
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,640
That's how I've come
to think about him.

38
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:10,450
Let's go home.

39
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:12,652
Everyone's waiting.

40
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,988
I don't want to.

41
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:19,625
I see...

42
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,195
I'll wait until you
change your mind.

43
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:25,764
Don't lie.

44
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm not lying.

45
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:34,806
For an hour after that, they
didn't say anything.

46
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,177
Hitomi?

47
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:41,480
Did you fall asleep?

48
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:44,749
I'm awake.

49
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:55,159
Your stomach's telling
you to go home.

50
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,399
We have your favorite...
croquettes.

51
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:09,507
Let's go home.

52
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:22,519
We're home!

53
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,792
Akira...

54
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,393
I'm home.

55
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,396
You haven't eaten yet?

56
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:38,435
Yuria and Shota refused to
eat until Akira came home.

57
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,576
Akira...

58
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:49,078
I asked Naoko to go home.

59
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,848
Yuzo took her home.

60
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:58,587
Naoko just sat there, and
she didn't stop crying.

61
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,525
So when you see her in school,
you should apologize.

62
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,699
I'm sorry, Dad.

63
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,741
I'm sorry, Yuria and Shota.

64
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,978
I didn't mean to
shock you...

65
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,981
They were just a little bit shocked...

66
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,683
They're ok.

67
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,585
Shall we eat?

68
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,820
Let's wash our hands.

69
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,964
Time for dinner!

70
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,335
After dinner...

71
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,243
This is...

72
00:07:56,243 --> 00:08:01,882
...a notebook, your mom and I
started when we took Keiko in

73
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:06,520
as a foster child... It's full
of things we learned.

74
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,359
They taught us a poem at the
foster parents' meeting...

75
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,964
It's such a nice poem...
Do you mind if I read it?

76
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:32,912
"There once were two women
who never knew each other..."

77
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,285
"You don't remember
one of them..."

78
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,222
You call the other
one, Mother"

79
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:50,629
"These two women are tied
to you and how you are"

80
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,198
"in a way that no one
else knows about."

81
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:57,836
"One watches over you
like the stars above..."

82
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:04,009
"The other one wraps you
in warmth like the sun..."

83
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:09,047
"One nurtured you inside her,
and gave birth to you..."

84
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:14,118
"The other one lived
her life with you."

85
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:18,823
"One gave you the strength
to go in search of love..."

86
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:24,095
"The other one loves you
no matter what happens."

87
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:27,932
"One made you a citizen
of your country..."

88
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:32,569
"The other one gave
you a name."

89
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,573
"One gave you the talent
you were born with..."

90
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:43,480
The other one nurtured that
talent, and gave you a dream."

91
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,685
"One gave you the power to
feel happiness and sadness..."

92
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:52,355
"The other one made you
feel safe when you were

93
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:55,191
filled with doubts."

94
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:58,828
"One always remembers your
cute smile when you were a

95
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:06,769
newborn baby... The other one
encompassed your sadness."

96
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:12,942
"One parted with you...
For your sake, out of

97
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:19,348
love for you. The other
one wanted to meet you

98
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:23,352
so badly, she prayed with
all her heart, and the gods

99
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:27,055
brought you two together
without hesitation."

100
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:31,927
"And now when you ask the
question that's been

101
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:35,497
bothering you all this
time, with tears in

102
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:44,405
your eyes, Which
is my real mother?"

103
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:52,213
"My dear child... They
are both your mother."

104
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:56,617
"You were blessed with
all kinds of love

105
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,320
from both your mothers."

106
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,324
That's the poem.

107
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,920
Akira...

108
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,630
When you said that I was
the only father you had

109
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:24,480
in this world, it made me
so happy, I could cry.

110
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,480
But...

111
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,060
That's not true...

112
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,020
You have another father
The one who brought you

113
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:38,324
into this world.

114
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:43,229
You mustn't forget
your father.

115
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:49,168
If it weren't for your
father, you and I would

116
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,004
never have met.

117
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,106
Like this poem...

118
00:11:55,341 --> 00:12:00,245
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you..

119
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:05,817
And I want you to become
a kind person who can

120
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:10,655
understand those reasons.

121
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,163
That's all I wanted to say.

122
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,190
That night, Katsutaro looked
through the photo albums

123
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,958
by himself...

124
00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:00,203
Although he is supposed to
be raising the children,

125
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:03,707
he feels that they are
raising him, too.

126
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:35,137
Akira wrote a letter of
apology to Naoko...

127
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:41,076
And he hopes that someday
he can meet his father

128
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,345
again with kindness
in his heart.

129
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:48,316
Hitomi went out in the
alleyway, and looked

130
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:52,821
at the nameplate with alI
the different last names.

131
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:56,257
And she wondered how much
of the children's happiness

132
00:13:56,257 --> 00:14:00,328
and sadness she would
be able to understand.

133
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:11,606
The May winds blew a
variety of emotions

134
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:14,975
through the alleyways
of Tsukishima.

135
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:24,651
Hitomi learned something
new again...

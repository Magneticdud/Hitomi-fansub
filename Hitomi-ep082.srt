CHAPTER 14
Mother Shows Up
Episode 82

2
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,027
Do you remember
your mother?

3
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:36,895
Not much.

4
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,699
Do you want
to see her?

5
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,811
Your mother called

6
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,416
and wants to see you.

7
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,053
She's sorry she didn't
call before now

8
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,858
What shall we do?

9
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,661
Do you want
to see her?

10
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,835
What did Shota say?

11
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,471
He wouldn't answer...

12
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,508
When it came to his mother,
he wouldn't say anything.

13
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,109
1

14
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,578
It's a mild case
of shock

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,048
It's quite common in
cases like this.

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,085
A lot of different
feelings are getting

17
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,920
entangled with each other..

18
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,222
He's holding back because he
doesn't want to hurt

19
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,091
his foster father and
his attachment to

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,559
his foster home...

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,529
After all it's? n living
at the Ippongi home

22
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,798
He probably loves his
life in Tsukishima.

23
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,803
Of course, part of it
could be that he can't

24
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,406
believe in his mother's
love since he hasn't

25
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,675
seen her for years.

26
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,111
It's only natural

27
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,914
But I don't think he's
refusing to see her

28
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,883
since his reaction
wasn't that strong.

29
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,153
He's probably having
conflicting feelings

30
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,955
about this right now

31
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,825
Iri e like this, what do
you think I should d0?

32
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,828
Do you think you could
see how Shota feels

33
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,598
while you go about
your everyday life?

34
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,569
We've already told him that
she contacted us.

35
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,971
you could see if
he's agreeable

36
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,575
It might be best to have
Katsutaro see how he

37
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,611
feels since Katsutaro is the
person he trusts most

38
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,314
Do you think you
could do that?

39
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,616
All right. I'll try

40
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,319
Thank you.

41
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,890
Is this you, Shota?

42
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:51,129

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,957
Thank you for coming.

59
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,227
See you again, Shota.

60
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,229
Goodbye

61
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,980
Yuria... Sorry to interrupt
while you're reading, but

62
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,049
it's almost ready, so
c lle^rybUy

63
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,456
How did it go today?

64
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,892
Did Shota say he wants
to see his mother?

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,094
He wouldn't say anything.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,598
I knew it! He doesn't
want to see her

67
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,566
We don't know that.

68
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,735
Being told something like
that all of a sudden.

69
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,137
He might have been
so surprised that

70
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,172
he didn't know
what to say

71
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,041
So what are you
going to do?

72
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm going to ask
Shota myself

73
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,217
It won't make any
difference...

74
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,055
He doesn't want to talk
about his mother

75
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,658
I want you to eat dinner
like you normally do

76
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,460
I'm acting normal.

77
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,961
No, you're not!

78
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,164
When you laughed yesterday
your face was all scrunched

79
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,765
up like this

80
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,767
You're kidding!

81
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,169
No, I'm not.

82
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,704
I'm not good at this...

83
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,038
It shows in my face
right away

84
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,241
I'm not good at it either
but I don't want Akira

85
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,243
and Yuria to worry.

86
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,281
At least until everything
is straightened out

87
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,817
1

88
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,919
Shota's been through
a lot today, so

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,355
I want you to try
to cheer him up

90
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,858
Do goodjT)..

91
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,628
Smile!

92
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,130
That's it.

93
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,898
How did you lose that
smile so fast?

94
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,300
Keep it in place

95
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,237
After dinner..

96
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,779
Shota

97
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,914
Can you come down
for a minute?

98
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,150
Okay

99
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,233
Akira

100
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,203
Shota went to the child care
counseling center today

101
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,739
h o

102
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,307
yi?i Sldj

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,155
What did you talk about
when you went to the

104
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,491
child care counseling
center today?

105
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,294
They kept me company
while I drew pictures.

106
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,829
Is that T! Hit?

107
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,535
Did you talk about
your mother

108
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,369
1

109
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,003
2

110
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:18,737
1

111
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,504
1

112
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,205
281

113
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,773
We did.

114
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,680
They told me your mother
contacted the child care

115
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,851
counseling center and said
she wants to see you.

116
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,655
What are you going to do?

117
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,924
Will you see her?

118
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,236
You don't have to
answer right now

119
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,606
Its OK then

120
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,775
If you have homework
and finish it

121
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,688
It's just as I thought
He doesn't want to see her

122
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,090
Why not?

123
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,160
As soon as you mentioned
his mother, I could

124
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,696
see him distance
himself from you.

125
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,268
You sound like a
psychologist.

126
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,373
That's what you call...

127
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,309
What are you talking about?

128
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,579
There's a proverb
that fits that...

129
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,182
You know which
one, don't you?

130
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,950
No, I don't.

131
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,520
Are you home, Katsu?

132
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,856
What was that
saying...

133
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,424
You know the one..

134
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,059
What are you
talking about?

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,562
You know... when an
amateur acts like

136
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,266
he knows everything, and
sticks his nose in all

137
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:58,470
kinds of things, and
ends up getting hurt.

138
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,138
I know which one!

139
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,274
"Bystanders see more
than the players"

140
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,976
That's not it...
It's the opposite.

141
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,445
That saying means that
when you're playing

142
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,182
chess or "no" the audience
can see what's going to

143
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:15,020
happen before the player
actually sees it.

144
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,722
That's right.

145
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,059
It says that it's better
to be a bystander.

146
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,962
I'm talking about
just the opposite.

147
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,698
You're right
It's the opposite

148
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,500
I got it...

149
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,136
"A little knowledge is
a dangerous thing"

150
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,704
That's right!
That's it.

151
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,474
That's what you were
doing just now

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,344
I don't understand,
but it's OK

153
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,315
Are you going
to Matsuri?

154
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,849
It's empty
right now

155
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,551
Maybe I'll go
with you

156
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,186
I need a change of pace.

157
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,454
Let's go

158
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,022
We're going then.

159
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,390
See you

160
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,280
Shota... What did you
talk to Dad about?

161
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,351
Nothing

162
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,156
What happened at
the center..?

163
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,460
You went there today,
didn't you?

164
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,895
Nothing.

165
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,046
Is something wrong
with Hitomi?

166
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,881
No... Why?

167
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,584
She was acting strange
at work today

168
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,354
She seemed to be riled up
about something.

169
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,090
She kept making mistakes
with the orders.

170
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,592
Eventually, the f^ss
scolded her and

171
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,661
told her to go
home early

172
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,231
Is she worried
about something?

173
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,868
They just won the dance
contest, so it doesn't

174
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,270
have anything to with
that, but maybe there's

175
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,640
something at home that
she's worried about

176
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,877
That's what I think.

177
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,547
You're absolutely right.

178
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,516
Aren't I?

179
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,118
Actually

180
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,657
Promise you won't talk
about this with anyone.

181
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,827
You know I won't...

182
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,096
t'inlmown forkee ing
my mouttrshtft

183
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,564
You poor man

184
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,399
Okay

185
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:49,974
Shota's mother called the
counseling center and

186
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:55,680
told them that she wants
to take Shota back.

187
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,820
foufneari the mother that
I^lia nt heard frdrnV

188
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,855
She disappeared and they
couldn't contact her

189
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,223
all this time

190
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,226
And did you tell
Shota about that?

191
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,563
I took him to the counseling
center today and the people

192
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:16,468
there explained what happened,
and asked him if he wants

193
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,870
to see her.

194
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,439
And?

195
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,775
He wouldn't say anything.

196
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:32,150
;ftntl I jsked him *t)out
mys 1f earlier.

197
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,952
Ht vas4h~^ame thing...

198
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,854
He wouldn't say anything.

199
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,755
He doesn't want
to see her

200
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,492
The way she abandoned him
for all these years...

201
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,627
What did you expect?

202
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,662
She's a terrible mother

203
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,098
Leaving him for someone
else to raise, and when

204
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,467
she wants to see him, she's
suddenly his mother..

205
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,136
You must be kidding.

206
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,639
You're saying the same
thing Hitomi said

207
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,076
Hitomi's only 20, so
I can understand how

208
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,779
lie cantiatfe^n opinion
ike that out

209
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,449
Yoti'rgjan&lint, so don't you
have a more mature opinion?

210
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,784
It doesn't matter whether
you're 20 or an adult...

211
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,120
When you what happened
Nlrn&ke ^ou^ngry.

212
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,389
That's called human
compassion

213
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,224
It may not be
that simple

214
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,627
That's right.
I agree with you

215
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,596
His mother may have had
her reasons for what

216
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,767
she did, and as for Shota,
she is his mother.

217
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,104
I'm pretty sure he
wants to see her

218
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,008
But it's hard for him to
deal with his feelings

219
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,143
after hearing about it
from you all of

220
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,878
a sudden like this.

221
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,648
(iViave iotianfi A*
to you, Man..

222
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,650
Just what I'd expect
from you

223
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,385
I agree with you.

224
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,788
jSo just going to wait
until Shota can put his

225
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,991
feelings into words.

226
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,395
You're wasting
your time

227
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,963
Why?

228
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,832
Shota hates his mother

229
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,001
You're so simple-minded

230
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,003
I said you're
simple-minded

231
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,142
Promise that you won't
tell anyone else

232
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,777
about this, okay?

233
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,512
Not a word!

234
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,847
I won't say
anything.

235
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,283
Hitomi began to realize
that what Shota was

236
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:49,420
feeling wasn't as simple
as she thought

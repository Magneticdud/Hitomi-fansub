00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,780
Trying too Hard to Find Happiness
Episode 56

2
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,406
The Ippongi family has been officially acknowledged by

3
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,376
the city of Tokyo as a foster care home.

4
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,845
Congratulations!

5
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,448
Thank you! We did it!

6
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,983
Can I take a look at it?

7
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,387
It's true, my name is on it!

8
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,190
Amazing!

9
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,429
The two-day training for newly registered

10
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,731
foster parents finally started.

11
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,369
At this training session, they'll have lectures

12
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,239
and group discussions, and also a chance to visit

13
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,408
one of the child care facilities.

14
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,045
Good morning!

15
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,214
Your name please...

16
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,582
It's Ippongi Hitomi.

17
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,351
These are today's materials.

18
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,156
Ms. Ippongi...

19
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,625
Good morning.

20
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,561
It's about to begin...

21
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,463
I know this will be useful for you.

22
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,000
It looks like...

23
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,969
...I'm the youngest one here, doesn't it?

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,138
Of course! There aren't many 20 year-old foster

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,672
parents around.

26
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,407
Oh, right.

27
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,543
Ms Ippongi...

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,712
Mr. Izumiya... Hello.

29
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,647
Isn't it great that you've been

30
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,882
recognized as a foster care home?

31
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,083
Thank you.

32
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,351
But it all starts now.

33
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,852
Please apply yourself and study hard.

34
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,087
I will.

35
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,093
This newly registered foster parents training is meant

36
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,129
for new foster parents who will be caring for

37
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,732
foster children in their homes.

38
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,371
A case like Hitomi's where she is living in the home

39
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,240
with the children as an assistant to Katsutaro

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,975
is very rare.

41
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,552
Good morning, everyone.

42
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,857
I'm Izumiya, the section chief of the child care

43
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,193
counseling center's treatment services section.

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,262
In school, we have what we call classmates or

45
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,898
contemporaries of the same school, but for all of you

46
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,434
who are here for this training class, you can be

47
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,204
considered foster parent classmates.

48
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,006
You're all here as foster parents.

49
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,908
Being a foster parent comes

50
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,476
with many hardships.

51
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,278
You can talk with each other about your concerns and

52
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,481
encourage each other...you'll feel like you

53
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,051
have someone to rely on.

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,486
Treasure this chance to meet each other,

55
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,991
enjoy the next two days, and make friends.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,534
Thank you...

57
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,140
People decide to become foster parents

58
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,443
for a variety of reasons.

59
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,081
They want to be useful to society in some way...

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,049
After raising their own children, they want to

61
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,118
raise another child...

62
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,654
Or there are those who don't have any children...

63
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,956
Whatever the reasons the foster parents and foster

64
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,392
children will form a new family.

65
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,730
You'll soon be meeting the children, and

66
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,067
these children for one reason or another are

67
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,371
no longer able to live with their parents.

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,875
Many of them have been deeply hurt,

69
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,544
and carry that hurt in their hearts.

70
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,713
But that's not the children's fault.

71
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,682
It's a family problem.

72
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:50,022
It could be illness, poverty, neglect...

73
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,424
There are a variety of circumstances.

74
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:56,194
These children carry more sadness and pain in

75
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,097
their hearts than we can even imagine.

76
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,668
Please let these children get a taste of what it

77
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,103
means to be a family

78
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,906
Make them realize how wonderful and warm

79
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,942
a family can be.

80
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:15,180
And that an adult is looking after them

81
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,984
Let them experience that feeling every single day

82
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,888
If you do that, you'll see the children's eyes sparkle

83
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,626
And they'll be able to enjoy going to school

84
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,234
What he said reminded Hitomi of

85
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,103
the three children living with them.

86
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:48,213
Shota, Yuria and Akira had smiles on their

87
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,818
faces now because of all the time they spent in

88
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,355
the warmth of Katsutaro and Setsuko's home.

89
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,296
And Keiko, too

90
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,906
In truth they're not my real parents, but I

91
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,877
thought - they are my parents,

92
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,780
and I am their child

93
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:31,156
These people who fully turn to face me ARE my parents

94
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,000
In the afternoon , they started a discussion

95
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,803
about becoming a foster parent

96
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,241
In each group, an experienced foster parent

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,644
served as an advisor

98
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,247
About the last name...

99
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,516
We're wondering whether to raise the child

100
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,920
using the child's real last name or our last name?

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,026
That is something to be concerned about, isn't it.

102
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,896
I think it's case by case.

103
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,433
For school children, thinking about when they leave home,

104
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,169
Many foster parents will use the child's real name

105
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,471
from the beginning

106
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,574
But for younger children, it's hard to know how

107
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,945
much they grasp the situation, and

108
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,348
to avoid confusion, a lot of foster homes

109
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,219
use their own last names as an alias.

110
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,057
In our case, the children all use their own last names

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,828
Our nameplate lists different names for three

112
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,563
of the children living with us

113
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,498
Are there young children?

114
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,067
Yes.. We have a child in the third grade

115
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,670
His name is Shota, and he uses his real name.

116
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,140
So you're already thinking  about the children's

117
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,441
future, aren't you?

118
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,613
To let them know they each have a life

119
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,249
of their own before they came to us.

120
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,956
One of the children is already independent,

121
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,793
and is a nurse now. Her name is Keiko...

122
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,496
She came over the other day to tell my grandpa that

123
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,265
she's getting married, and to ask for his approval..

124
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,767
Grandpa told her that she didn't have to worry

125
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,137
about what he thought anymore... In fact,

126
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,907
he was grateful that she came home to him as if

127
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,576
she were his real daughter

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,047
Keiko was this little, and now she's telling me that

129
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,916
Keiko was this little, and now she's telling me that

130
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,420
she's getting married. Isn't it strange!

131
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,670
This is what you brought the hijiki (type of seaweed) in.

132
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,709
And this was the "kinpira gobo" (fried burdock root)

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,578
It was really delicious

134
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,016
This one was the gomayagoshi (black sesame sauce).

135
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,052
Do you want to count them all again?

136
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,622
Katsu... You remember when Keiko broke all of those

137
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,758
planters over there

138
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,462
! do... Keiko really was a handful

139
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,233
She was the first child we took in as foster parents

140
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,702
She grew up to be a really good daughter

141
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,872
Thanks to all the hardship you went through to raise her.

142
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,574
I watered them everyday.

143
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,842
I'm talking about Keiko!

144
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,849
Being a nurse is hard work, and a respectable profession

145
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,385
Maybe I should enter them in the next exhibition

146
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,821
Not the plants, Keiko!

147
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,356
I know!

148
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,658
You're hopeless.

149
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,566
Hello!

150
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,101
Hitomi...

151
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,438
How was today's training?

152
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,373
I really learned a lot

153
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,610
I feel like we're classmates

154
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,679
I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,082
It must be rough

156
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,284
You have to do a training like this everytime

157
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,020
You register new foster parents, don't you?

158
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,824
Yes, but we still don't have enough foster parents.

159
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,627
There are so many children who need foster care

160
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,396
So, even if we're busy, we don't mind.

161
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,133
Hitomi....you have one more day's training..

162
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,635
Please do your best.

163
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,769
I will.

164
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,505
Goodbye.

165
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,742
Thanks for your hard work!

166
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,778
The next day, they went to visit a home

167
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,613
for orphaned,

168
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,147
neglected or abused children.

169
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,119
It looks like everyone's here, doesn't it?

170
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,123
My face is small, my heart is big, and they call me

171
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,759
Kubota, the man with the mustache

172
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:07,098
The children who will be comihg to live with all

173
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,902
of you, have all lived here at a facility like this

174
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,472
or at a home for infants.

175
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,009
The children are all at school right now, so

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,845
we'll start by looking at the dormitory

177
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,848
I'm going to check with the dormitory first,

178
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,650
so please wait here for a moment

179
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,690
Hitomi?

180
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,292
Keiko!

181
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,861
What are you doing here?

182
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,665
We came to see the orphanage as part of our training.

183
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,301
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,539
I was raised here, before I went to live in Tsukishima

185
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,808
Is that right?

186
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,645

00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,214

00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,185
Do you know each other?

00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,522
She's my Tsukishima father's granddaughter

190
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,825
She's looking after Shota and the other children

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,960
Is that right? Nice to meet you.

00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,305

00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,541
I'm sorry to intrude

00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:29,748
I came here today because I have an announcement..

197
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,716

198
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,152
I'm going to get married.

199
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,322

200
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,526

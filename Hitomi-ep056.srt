00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,670
This is what you brought the

132
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,709
And this was the "kinpira

It was r 'Slly delicious

was a handfiil

139
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,233
She was the first child we
took in as foster parents

She grew up to£>e a

Being a TfrSe is hard work, and

00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,822
that I missed my father

67
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,686
We Jho atV/ould

68
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,322
I'm sorry to worry you

69
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,661

SoJVIikie s going to
meet her f Ih T?

73
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,886
He's coming all the way
out here from izu Os ima

74
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:28,160
ftlikie said that she felt
her father deserted jier

75
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,362
when she wa li ie

76
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,831
So if she meets with him,
and they canThake^ip,

77
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,866
she might settle down
a itttle bit

78
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,637
But will it be that easy9

79
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,507
jjjpfou ont think
til workout?

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,410
It's hard when ^t comes to
a father and daughter

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,679
Once the relationship
falls apart, it's hard

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,514
to mend the relationship

83
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,152
You're talking about
you and Mom

84
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,095
I hope he's a nice manx

hat's right

123
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,311
If things work out between

to feei more secure

125
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,050

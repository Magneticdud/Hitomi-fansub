7
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,293
Mikie?

8
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,297
What's wrong?

9
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,201
This song.

10
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,239
It's Miyako Harumi's "Anko
Tsubaki wa Koi no Hana."

11
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:54,613
When I was little my father
used to sing it ail the time

12
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,397
Anko Tsubaki..

13
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,938
What do you want to hear?

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,741
You were waiting for him,
weren't you7

15
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,878
Do you know the s fig
' ftkoTsublci..."?

16
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,714
Sure, Anko Tsubaki
wa Koi no Hana"

17
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,882
That's the one.

18
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,083
It's a nice song

19
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,851
It's a famous song
from the Showa era

20
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,820
In answer to your
request..

21
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,989
You don't have to sing it

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,690
What's the song about?

23
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,792
What does the "anko" in
Anko Tsubaki" mean?

24
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,729
It's the sweet bean paste

25
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,931
The honey from the "tsubaki"
(camellia) is so sweet it's

26
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,433
like anko. That's what
the song is about

27
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,035
You're wrong

28
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,570
Don't teach he*
the wrong thing.

29
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,272
Then what is it about?

30
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,207
Anko is the name of
the girl who picks

31
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,975
the tsubaki (camellia)

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,478
Tsubaki abura (camellia
oil) is the specialty of

33
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,913
Izu Oshima, isn't it?

34
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,115
it's an Izu Oshima song

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,053
It's an Island, so
even the mail came by boat

36
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,289
That's why part of the
song is "carrying the

37
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,958
letter three days late."

38
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,030
Don't sing

39
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,898
You'll disturb
the neighbors

40
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,033
I want to sing

41
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,035
You'd better not sing

42
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,570
If you do, Ume will
fall down

43
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,837
Good night!

44
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,239
Don't pinch my ear!

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,774
Ouch! That hurts!

46
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,050
Several days later, Hitomi
went to the child care

47
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,651
counseling center

48
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,888
They told her that Mikie had
something to tell her

49
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,593
We talked about my father
tiia JUrfi

50
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,462
That he was alive and
living in his home town.

51
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,498
By chance, is it
Izu Oshima

52
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,134
That's right,

53
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,869
How did you know?

54
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,972
Anko Tsubaki...

55
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,374
I learned that it's an
Izu Oshima song.

56
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,078
You told me, didn't you...

57
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,014
That you thought
I should see him.

58
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,252
When I heard that song in the
coffee shop, I realized

59
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,822
that I missed my father

60
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,662
I tried calling him

61
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,368
You did? And?

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,071
He was surprised, but it
sounded like he was happy

63
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,174
He's a fisherman
on the island

64
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,111
When I told him about
me and Shota, he said

65
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,414
he'll come to Tokyo
and meet us.

66
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,517
Isn't it great?

67
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,686
We Jho would
be a good idea.

68
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,322
I'm sorry to worry you

69
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,661
I'm a little nervous, but
I'm going to meet him.

70
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,364
Thank you, Hitomi

71
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,201
Thanks to you, I 
made up my mind

72
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,981
So Mikie's going to
meet her father?

73
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,886
He's coming all the way
here from Izu Oshima

74
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:28,160
Mikie said that she felt
her father deserted her

75
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,362
when she wa little

76
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,831
So if she meets with him,
and they can make up,

77
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,866
she might settle down
a little bit

78
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,637
But will it be that easy?

79
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,507
You don't think
it will work out?

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,410
It's hard when it comes to
a father and daughter

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,679
Once the relationship
falls apart, it's hard

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,514
to mend the relationship

83
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,152
You're talking about
you and Mom

84
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,095
I hope he's a nice man

85
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,297
That "Anko Tsubaki" father.

86
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:22,981
â€¢s t

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,917


I'm leaving!

88
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,284

89
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,856
I'm leaving!

90
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,029
It's a g tSfhhin

91
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,067
It'll be a relief for
Shota's mother if 

92
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,337
sees her father after all
this time and they can

93
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,572
clear the air
between them

94
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,374
No matter what you say,
you can rely most

95
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,643
on your parents,
isn't it so?

96
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,246
But Grandpa's worried that
if they meet, they'll

97
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,814
just start fighting

98
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,816
He's talking
about himself

99
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,718
Don't worry, Hitomi...

100
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,319
A father and daughter
like those two don't

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,821
come along too often.

102
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,955
That's true

103
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,323
a ing o zu t)sh m .

104
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,526
The fish from here is
delicious, isn't it?

105
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,627


106
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,829
They tna e "kusa^a" salted,
sun-dried fish here

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,897
That's right.

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,144
It's a nice place..

114
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,380
if he's a fisherman mg
ni e place like that

115
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,148
I'm sure he's a nice man.

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,690
The way your parents raise
you has a lot to do with

117
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:43,662
the way you raise your
own child, doesn't it?

118
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,764
A child's problem is
the parent's problem,

119
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,600
and it all comes back to the
parent, doesn't it?

120
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,472
Shota's mother, and her
fisherman father

121
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,674
You mean the "Anko Tsubaki" dad?

122
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,942
That's right

123
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,311
If things work out between
those two, then it'll

124
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,947
help Shota and his mother
to feel more secure

125
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,050
I hope "Anko Tsubaki" helps
to work things out.

126
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,656
We don't need a musical
accompaniment

127
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,398
Doesn't that song get
stuck in your head?

128
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,634
It does

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,071
The part after that...

130
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,245
That's it

131
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,753
Sending a letter to the
one you love, but no

132
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,055
answer comes back
A one-way letter.

133
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,892
That's pretty fanciful...

134
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,194
I sent Mari a
one-way letter

135
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,164
Mari, it's time for an
answer to come back.

136
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,200
Just kidding.

137
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,401
Don't get swept up in
the moment and say

138
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,502
something strange

139
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,503
You figured it out?

140
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,404
dl .

141
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,939
I'm embarrassed

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,543
He's turning red...and
it's not the sake.

143
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,723
Mikie asmffeting
<fa o ay

144
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,034

145
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,397
Mikie.

146
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,881
You've grown up

147
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,587
You're a grown
woman now

148
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,593
Of course, after you left,
I grew up, and had a child

149
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,763
of my own

150
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,403
I can't say anything when you
say something like that

151
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,408
Why did you leave me?

152
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:49,814
Why did you leave us behind
and go to the island7

153
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,888
Didn't your mother
say anything?

154
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:04,195
She said you hated Tokyo,
so you left us and ran back

155
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,498
to the island

156
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,605

157
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,176
V h st9 eres

159
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:31,022
About the time their land

160
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,058
Mt. Mihara ruled..

161
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,860
Mt Mihara

162
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:41,666
In 1986, when you
were seven

163
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,540
My siblings and relatives were
fishermen on the island

164
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,477
Their houses and boats
were all destroyed

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,816
No matter ov m mil y
they had, it wasn't enough

166
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:03,254
So they "fere was
some way I could helpi m

167
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,224

171
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:23,374
We  ti m toward

172
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,010
I couldn't stop

173
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,051
and turn my
back on them

174
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,857

176
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,434
So if you and your mother
thought I abandoned

177
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,537
you, then I guess it
can't be helped

178
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,175
Ui

00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,275
I was raised here... before
I went to live in Tsukishima.

12
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,828
I came here today because
I have an announcement...

13
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,997
What is it?

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,467
I'm going to
get married

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,671

00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,175

If you have a uestions,
don't hesitate o ask.

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,362
a c If there are two
t ren in each room

47
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,497
After they get home from
school, this is where

48
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,766
they study and steep..

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,371
They share the dressers.

50
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,275
They decide on who shares
the room by Compatibility

51
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,812
Basically iblin s re e

53
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,352
Of course, we do our best to
take care of the chil r n

54
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,824
However, the staff can't be
on duty for 24 hours a day

55
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,629
So we can't have the same
peopie who seFthem off

56
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,766
in the morning, welcome them
lome in the afternoon.

57
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,004
But when ey^jo to a foster
home,4he"samepeople who

58
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,642
see them off in the morning
will be there to welcome

59
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,011
them horn. e yday

60
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,580
You'll befi leidfflal with
the child q ne

61
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,350
That's why j wan to ask
"Tltitju*

62
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,953
the children with a Completely
norm 1 family environment,

63
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,889
and treat em in a manner
that's completely normal.

64
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,926
These are children*who have
been raised in an environment

65
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,663
Where the ouldn't trust in
the parents who they should

66
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,098
have e n able to
trus the most

67
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,000
That's it's hard for them
to develop relationships

68
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,602
with other people

69
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,837
The most important thing is
for^yG to show them that

70
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,775
they can tr people
That they can trust adults.

71
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,147
What's the best way
o uo inai.

72
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:20,819
~You all have it
right here

73
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,255
That's all I hav o say

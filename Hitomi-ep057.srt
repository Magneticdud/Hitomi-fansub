00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,060
Hitomi?

3
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,296
Keiko!

4
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,598
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,135
We came to see the orphanage as part of our training.

6
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,371
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,275
I was raised here... before I went to live in Tsukishima.

8
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,778
Oh, really!

9
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,782
This is one of our graduates.

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,852
I looked after her for three years

11
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,322
I'm sorry to intrude

12
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,828
I came here today because I have an announcement...

13
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:11,997
What is it?

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,467
I'm getting married

15
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,671
Really?

16
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,175
Congratulations!

17
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,576
Thank you.

18
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,080
Thank you very much.

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,485
We have three different dormitory buildings

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,887
Lined up here

21
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,457
There are about 60 childcare facilities

22
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,726
like the one that Keiko was raised in

23
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:41,927
There are approximately 3,000 children living

24
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,195
There are approximately 3,000 children living

25
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,897

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,910
There are about 100 children currently living here in

29
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,179
this facility

30
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,049
Of those 00 children, Ihere e children

00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,187
our group of eight

33
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,190
The youngest is in the first grade, and the

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,425
oldest is in the sixth grade

35
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,661
There ree staff members caring for

36
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,062
the eight children.

37
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,998
They treat them like their own children

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,934
I'll take you inside now

39

40
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,406
Hello!

00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,543

You can o at the bath ove e, too.

45
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,523
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,362
a c If there are two t ren in each room

47
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,497
After they get home from school,

48
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,766
this is where they study and sleep..

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,371
They share the dressers.

50
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,275
They decide who shares the room by compatibility

51
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,812
Basically siblings are together in the same room

52
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,679
1

53
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,352
Of course, we do our best to take care of the children

54
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,824
However, the staff can't be on duty for 24 hours a day

55
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,629
So we can't have the same people who see them off

56
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,766
in the morning, welcome them home in the afternoon.

57
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,004
But when they go to a foster home, the same people who

58
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,642
see them off in the morning will be there to welcome

59
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,011
them home everyday

60
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,580
You'll befi leidfflal with the child q ne

61
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,350
That's why j wan to ask "Tltitju*

62
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,953
the children with a completely normal family environment,

63
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,889
and treat them in a completely normal manner.

64
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,926
These are children who have been raised in an environment

65
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,663
Where they couldn't trust their parents, those 

66
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,098
they should have been able to trust the most

67
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,000
so it's hard for them to develop

68
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,602
relationships with other people

69
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,837
The most important thing is for you to show them

70
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,775
that they can trust people, trust adults.

71
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,147
What's the best way to do that?

72
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:20,819
You all have it right here

73
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,255
That's all I have to say

74
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,298
Thank you

75
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,172
Hitomi... Are you done?

76
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,507
My training is over

77
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,676
Will you come to the playground with me

78
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,411
and talk to Mr. Kubota?

79
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,680
It's my favorite place.

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,950
Is it this way?

81
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,299
It was your dream to get married, wasn't it?

82
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,469
I wanted have my own family life as soon

83
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,170
as I could because

84
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,273
I didn't have enough of that in my life

85
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,578
I'm really grateful to you, Kubo-papa

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,816
when I came here, I was an unruly child, wasn't I?

87
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,818
It was terrible

88
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,987
You'd run through the halls carrying a mop,

89
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,056
breaking the window glass along the way

90
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,058
Yelling, "I'm going to mymofti," and I had to

91
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,227
after you all the wa j o iinjuku 

92
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,528
middle of the night.

93
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,098
But I'm no longer unruly like that.

94
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,137
You used to scold me every single day

95
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,940
At the beginning I hated you.

96
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,746
I eventually understood you scolded me

97
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,315
because you cared about me.

98
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,488
When I realized that, I learned to love you

99
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,161
Dad and Mom in Tsukishima took really 

100
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,563
good care of me, too.

101
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,033
They helped me come this far and meet

102
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:19,137
someone who asked me to marry him.

103
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,977
h & true, that the most important thing is

104
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,381
that you work hard at it

105
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,484
That's why I want to congratulate you

106
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm going in to see the director now...

107
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,589
He had visitors earlier

108
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,724
Go ahead

109
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,593

110
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,129

H ¥% \ C '

112
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,766
She's really grown up..

113
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,335
SheTlk^sjf she owns the world.

114
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,974
When she first came here she didn't trust

115
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,943
any adult at all

116
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,679
Is that right?

117
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,050
She must have been lone!y

118
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,520
She was so wild. She didn't open up to any

119
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,856
of the children or adults here

120
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,727
Just look at how she's grown, and now

121
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,631
she's found someone to make a home with

122
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,133
It makes me happy ..

123
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,303
I couldn't be happier

124
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,926
e s^ilce, snlfcfe?

125
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,396
He said he couldn't be

126
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,899
I'm really happy, too

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,635
When I went to the staff room, 

128
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,503
everyone was so happy for me

129
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,240
For the sake of those people, I have to be happy.

130
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,445
How are things with you and Mr. Katsumata lately?

131
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,483
I haven't heard from him for the last few days.

132
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,553
He should be back from his business trip

133
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,221
by rib v^but.

134
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,757
Ma oeJ sti \ild give him fa I.

135
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,963
Shall we take a walk?

136
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,131
Let's go

137
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,868
Hitomi couldn't bring herself to tell Keiko

138
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,370
that she had seen Mr. Katsumata in Atami

139
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:33,438

140

1

141
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,374
Hello?

142
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,108
1

143
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,877
Are you home?

144
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,447

r i. with i omi right now, soi'llb nghT^/ithme

148
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,338
You do have a fever, after all.

149
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,773
You're not coughing, are you?

150
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,408
No, but my throat's a little sore

151
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,110
Let me see

152
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,947
It's a little bit red

153
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,817
Just drink this. It's one of the best 

154
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,852
medicines on the market

155
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,122
I'll get you some water.

156
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,624
Thanks.

157
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,827
You should stay in bed

158
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,662
I don't know why you have to work

159
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,097
when you stayed home from work

160
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,999
I can't stay in bed

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,634
My deadline is tomorrow

162
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,070
Excuse me.

163
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,742
You were on a business trip the other day, weren't you?

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,813
On Saturday.

165
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,018
That's right... I had to go to the Kansai area..

166
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,987
Kansai (Kyoto, Osaka)?

167
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,756
That's right.

168
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,159
Did something happen while you were on your business trip?

169
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,260
Why?

170
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,995
For you to get sick like this

171
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,731
I was just worn out, that's all.

172
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,870
Anyway when you finish that, go right to bed!

173
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,906
I'd like to stay with you, but 

174
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,341
I'm on the night shift tonight

175
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,977
I'll go to bed as soon as I finish this

176
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,178
Thanks

177
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,249
Shall i make you some rice porridge?

178
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,885
Do you have any eggs?

179
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,753
I should have some in the refrigerator.

180
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,189
Sorry to trouble you

181
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,959
When did you buy this egg?

182
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,462
I think it was the day before I

183
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,730
left for my business trip

184
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,502
I'm sorry I'm such a bad host

185
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,742
Not at all... In fact, I feel like I'm in the way

186
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,180
No, you're not; it's better that you're here

187
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,316
We haven't had time to go out lately so if

188
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,019
you weren't here, she would probably scold me more

189
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,698
Thank you.

190
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,400
Not at all

191
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,740
Hitomi! Sorry to keep you waiting

192
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,210
At least I got him into bed

193
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,845
He really needs a lot of care

194
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,247
I had to work even before I go to the hospital.

195
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,383
What is it?

196
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,019
I have to talk to you about something.

197
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,356
What is it? You look so serious

198
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,725
Can we have tea somewhere?

199
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,027
I have to go to the hospital

200
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,462
i do aye time

201
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,331
We can talk while we walk then

202
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,500
No... It me right here

203
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,835
You have me worried.

204
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,471
Not here

205
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,007
It's a little too close

206
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,109
Just thinking that he's right here

207
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,251
Is it about Mr. Katsumata?

208
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,462
I saw Mr. Katsumata with another woman.

209
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,901
But it could be someone from his company...

210
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:24,502
1

211
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,607
They were wearing cotton kimono 

212
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,409
and walking arm-in-arm.

213
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,845
Where?

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,081
At a hot springs in Atami

215
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,686
I went there on Saturday to dance for a part-time job

216
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,656
But he was on a business trip in the Kansai area

217
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,024
That's right

218
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,093
That's why I thought it was strange.

219
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,930
Did you talk to him?

220
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,301
ixlon \hi he noticed me

221
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,703
It was someone else.

222
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,638
No, it wasn't.

223
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,208
I'm sure it was Mr. Katsumata

224
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,444
But it couldn't be him!

225
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,849
Why would he be in Atami with another woman?

226
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,285
Why don't you ask him?

227
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,856
That's not necessary

228
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,924
Don't be ridiculous!

229
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,195
e n e ray e

230
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,201
It was someone else

231
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,171
I won't believe it.

232
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,708
Don't ever bring it up again!

233
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,445
Keiko..

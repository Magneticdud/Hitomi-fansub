4
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,833
To the place where you parted
with your real father when

5
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,168
you were five years old.

6
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,338
I don't want to go

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,676
What are you doing?

8
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,612
Were you the "king
about Naoko?

9

It's a party or some
kind of event, £ut..

17
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,880
Anyway, it's the first time
I'm going to get paid for

18
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,648
dancing, so I'm looking
forward to it

19
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,049
I'm leaving

20
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,551

24
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,131
The library

25
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,334
Isn't... Naoko
coming today?

26
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,837
I don't think so.

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,039
We didn't plan anything

28
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,577
itsee... you/Jidn't
Ian anythin

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,647
So I guess she's not
coming today then.

30
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,082
If you did, she would
come Wouldn't She?

bothered about seeing Naoko

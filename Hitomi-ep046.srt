CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 46

2
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,660
Shall we do this
coming Sunday?

3
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,129
Where to?

4
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,833
To the place where you parted
with your real father when

5
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,168
you were five years old.

6
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,338
I don't want to go.

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,676
What are you doing?

8
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,612
Were you the thinking
about Naoko?

9
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,081
No, I wasn't.

10
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,153
Good night.

11
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,293
He's embarrassed.

12
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,599
It's Sunday.

13
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,401
Hitomi?

14
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,338
Where are you going to dance
for this part-time job?

15
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,373
I won't know until I go.

16
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,210
It's a party or some
kind of event, but...

17
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,880
Anyway, it's the first time
I'm going to get paid for

18
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,648
dancing, so I'm looking forward to it.

19
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,049
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,551
Do your best.

21
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,124
Akira...

22
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,826
What are you going
to do today?

23
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,530
After lunch, maybe I'll
go to the library.

24
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,131
The library...?

25
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,334
Isn't... Naoko
coming today?

26
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,837
I don't think so...

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,039
We didn't plan anything.

28
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,577
I see... you didn't
plan anything...

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,647
So I guess she's not
coming today then.

30
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,082
If you did, she would
come, wouldn't she?

31
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,051
You didn't make any
plans for today?

32
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,419
No, I didn't.

33
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,123
This is my first
time in Aoyama.

34
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,561
But having an office in
Aoyama is chic, isn't it?

35
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,631
I wonder what I.C. stands for in I.C. Promotion?

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,200
I.C. ...

37
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,938
I know what it is!

38
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,675
Inter... national...

39
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,276
National?

40
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,544
City!

41
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,313
That might be it!

42
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,117
Maybe it's a major
production company.

43
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,253
It might be!

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,328
It should be around here.

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,132
This is it, isn't it?

46
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,767
Maybe it's a little
further in.

47
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,135
No, it's not.

48
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,677
I found it.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,547
Here it is.

50
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,320
Here?

51
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,762
I know what I.C. stands for...

52
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,064
Right there...

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,003
Ishii Chuji...?

54
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,508
Are you the part-timers?

55
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,445
I'm Ishii Chuji,
the president.

56
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,821
I hope you're not going
to say you wont do it.

57
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,156
Can we?

58
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,058
Please don't say that,

59
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,893
I'm asking you as
your manager.

60
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,828
I'm asking you, too.

61
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,431
Thanks for waiting.

62
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,832
Shall we get going?

63
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,036
Where are we going?

64
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,138
To the amusement park.

65
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,584
They're called "Eyebrow Cats", and they're

66
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,687
quite popular with the kids.

67
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,624
Here's a picture you can use
for reference for he make-up.

68
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,992
Something like this...

69
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,627
The rest you can do
whatever you want.

70
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,835
Don't forget the eyebrows.

71
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,770
It's an important point...

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,639
After all, it's "Eyebrow cats".

73
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,575
What kind of event is it?

74
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,212
There's a stage outside
that door over there...

75
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,549
To put it simply, it's amusement
park children's show.

76
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,750
You see them often, don't you?

77
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,686
You go on for 15 minutes
each time at 12, 1 and 2.

78
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,789
So you get paid 8000 yen for
45 minutes of actual work.

79
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,559
It's really popular with
students, but if you

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,028
hire them all separately,
some don't show up, so

81
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,230
it's good that there
are four of you.

82
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,398
Here's the video.

83
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,601
The dance moves are on
the video, so just take

84
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:13,638
a look, and practice a
little before you go on.

85
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,246
Let's just look at the video...

86
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,015
I can't do this!

87
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,251
I can't do it either.

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,586
Wait a minute!

89
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,556
I know how you feel, but...

90
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,525
For one thing, Moe...!

91
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,492
Yes?

92
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,494
You're the one who found
this job, aren't you?

93
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,030
That's right. Why didn't
you check into it first?

94
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,999
But I thought it
would be good.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,535
It was for four people, and
I thought it would be the

96
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,371
chance you needed
to form a unit.

97
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,939
I'm not dancing in a unit.

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,742
And besides, doing something
like this wouldn't work.

99
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,877
Hitomi's the one
who suggested it.

100
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,046
Because I want us
to form a unit.

101
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,881
Dancing forms
friendships.

102
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,918
I thought we could go on
to Dance Beat from here.

103
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,187
It's impossible with
this group...

104
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,155
If I'm going to do it,
I'll look for other

105
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,423
people to form a unit.

106
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,891
Me, too.

107
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,326
How can you say it's
impossible when we

108
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,961
haven't even done
anything yet?

109
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,130
You don't know until
you do something.

110
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,432
What's going to happen
with that kind of dance?

111
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,168
Even for children, it's
pretty low level.

112
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,371
We'll change the
dance moves...

113
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,240
Let's come up with our
own dance moves.

114
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,076
Mr. Ishii...?

115
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,512
Do you mind if we arrange
the dance moves ourselves?

116
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,514
Sure... As long as the
children like it, you

117
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,182
can change it as much
as you want.

118
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,018
You heard him...

119
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,754
What are you going
to do, Yuka?

120
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,624
How many minutes
do we have?

121
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,128
If you subtract the time
to get ready, we have

122
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,730
thirty minutes left.

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,766
Junko...?

124
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,735
Help me.

125
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,344
From the top...

126
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,389
How about this?

127
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,827
That's cool!

128
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,566
What about this?

129
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,910
Moe! Your steps
are all wrong.

130
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,846
Do it like this...

131
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:29,200
It's time to get ready.

132
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,570
Standby...

133
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,073
Let's have fun, and dance.

134
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,879
Hello, everybody!

135
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,686
Where's your spirit?

136
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,256
Once more!

137
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,190
Hello!

138
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,025
Hello!

139
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,597
Well done!

140
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:04,202
You'll be seeing some fun
friends here on stage.

141
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,172
Let's all dance
together.

142
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,779
Here we go!

143
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,675
Those were the "Eyebrow cats".

144
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,212
Give them a hand, everyone!

145
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,783
Thank you, "Eyebrow cats".

146
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,969
It went pretty well, didn't it?

147
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,739
You made the wrong turn, Moe.

148
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,373
We need to practice.

149
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,944
That was wonderful!

150
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,146
The children loved it!

151
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,915
Just what you'd expect
from dancers.

152
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,518
I'm counting on you guys
for the next performance.

153
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,987
Take a break for an hour.

154
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,822
Here you go!

155
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,924
On the house!

156
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,395
It's warm.

157
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,866
Cheers!

158
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,808
After finishing the three
stage performances,

159
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,445
thanks to the generosity
of the president, Hitomi

160
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,448
enjoyed a day at the
amusement park.

161
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,834
Hey! Keep moving!

162
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,435
I'm sorry...

163
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,137
I'm going. I'm sorry.

164
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,948
Naoko?

165
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,553
It's you!

166
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,223
Wait! What's wrong?

167
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,164
Don't tell Sano.

168
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,068
Goodbye.

169
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,237
Naoko!

170
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,609
What was Naoko doing
here anyway?

171
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,853
Here's your fee.

172
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,356
I even added a bonus.

173
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,426
If you don't mind, please
come and do it again.

174
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,361
Thank you for your
hard work today.

175
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,495
Thank you!

176
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,231
Shall we go?

177
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,306
Here you go...

178
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,810
Thank you!

179
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,747
It's the first time she
got paid to dance.

180
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,619
While she savored the
happiness, she was

181
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,823
bothered about seeing Naoko
alone at the amusement park.

182
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,820
To be continued...

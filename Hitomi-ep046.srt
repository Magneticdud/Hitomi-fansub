CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 46

3
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,341
Shall we do this
coming Sunday?

4
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:36,777
Where to?

5
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,480
To the place where you parted
with your real father when

6
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,816
you were five years old.

7
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,986
I don't want to go.

8
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:50,323
What are you doing?

9
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,293
Were you the thinking
about Naoko?

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,762
No, I wasn't.

11
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:00,800
Good night.

12
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,940
He's embarrassed.

13
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,245
It's Sunday.

14
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,081
Hitomi?

15
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:18,984
Where are you going to dance
for this part-time job?

16
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:21,053
I won't know until I go.

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,890
It's a party or some
kind of event, but...

18
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,559
Anyway, it's the first time
I'm going to get paid for dancing,

19
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,294
so I'm looking forward to it.

20
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,695
I'm leaving.

21
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:32,230
Do your best.

22
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:38,770
Akira...

23
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,471
What are you going
to do today?

24
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:44,208
After lunch, maybe I'll
go to the library.

25
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,810
The library...?

26
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:48,980
Isn't... Naoko
coming today?

27
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,482
I don't think so...

28
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,684
We didn't plan anything.

29
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:58,222
I see... you didn't
plan anything...

30
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,292
So I guess she's not
coming today then.

31
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,761
If you did, she would
come, wouldn't she?

32
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,729
You didn't make any
plans for today?

33
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,064
No, I didn't.

34
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:10,801
This is my first
time in Aoyama.

35
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,238
But having an office in
Aoyama is chic, isn't it?

36
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:19,309
I wonder what I.C. stands
for in I.C. Promotion?

37
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,877
I.C. ...

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,582
I know what it is!

39
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:29,352
Inter... national...

40
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:30,920
National?

41
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,221
City!

42
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,990
That might be it!

43
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,761
Maybe it's a major
production company.

44
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:40,930
It might be!

45
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,971
It should be around here.

46
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:53,809
This is it, isn't it?

47
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,410
Maybe it's a little
further in.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,812
No, it's not.

49
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,320
I found it.

50
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,189
Here it is.

51
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,996
Here?

52
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,438
I know what I.C. stands for...

53
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,740
Right there...

54
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:30,678
Ishii Chuji...?

55
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,150
Are you the part-timers?

56
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm Ishii Chuji,
the president.

57
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,496
I hope you're not going
to say you won't do it.

58
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:50,831
Can we?

59
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,733
Please don't say that,

60
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,568
I'm asking you as
your manager.

61
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,503
I'm asking you, too.

62
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,105
Thanks for waiting.

63
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,507
Shall we get going?

64
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,710
Where are we going?

65
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:05,812
To the amusement park.

66
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,258
They're called "Eyebrow Cats",

67
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,360
and they're
quite popular with the kids.

68
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:25,297
Here's a picture you can use
for reference for the make-up.

69
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,665
Something like this...

70
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,300
The rest you can do
whatever you want.

71
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:36,508
Don't forget the eyebrows.

72
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,443
It's an important point...

73
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,312
After all, it's "Eyebrow cats".

74
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,248
What kind of event is it?

75
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:46,885
There's a stage outside
that door over there...

76
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:50,221
To put it simply, it's amusement
park children's show.

77
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,423
You see them often, don't you?

78
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:54,359
You go on for 15 minutes
each time at 12, 1 and 2.

79
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,462
So you get paid 8000 yen for
45 minutes of actual work.

80
00:05:57,462 --> 00:06:00,231
It's really popular with
students, but if you

81
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,700
hire them all separately,
some don't show up, so

82
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,902
it's good that there
are four of you.

83
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:06,070
Here's the video.

84
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:09,273
The dance moves are on
the video, so just take

85
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:13,310
a look, and practice a
little before you go on.

86
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,918
Let's just look at the video...

87
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:56,686
I can't do this!

88
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,921
I can't do it either.

89
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,257
Wait a minute!

90
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:04,226
I know how you feel, but...

91
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,195
For one thing, Moe...!

92
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:07,162
Yes?

93
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,164
You're the one who found
this job, aren't you?

94
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:11,700
That's right. Why didn't
you check into it first?

95
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,669
But I thought it
would be good.

96
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:16,204
It was for four people, and
I thought it would be the

97
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:19,040
chance you needed
to form a unit.

98
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,609
I'm not dancing in a unit.

99
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:23,411
And besides, doing something
like this wouldn't work.

100
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,547
Hitomi's the one
who suggested it.

101
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,716
Because I want us
to form a unit.

102
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,551
Dancing forms
friendships.

103
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:32,587
I thought we could go on
to Dance Beat from here.

104
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:34,856
It's impossible with
this group...

105
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,824
If I'm going to do it,
I'll look for other

106
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,092
people to form a unit.

107
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,560
Me, too.

108
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,995
How can you say it's
impossible when we

109
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,630
haven't even done
anything yet?

110
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,799
You don't know until
you do something.

111
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,101
What's going to happen
with that kind of dance?

112
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,837
Even for children, it's
pretty low level.

113
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,040
We'll change the
dance moves...

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,908
Let's come up with our
own dance moves.

115
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,745
Mr. Ishii...?

116
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,180
Do you mind if we arrange
the dance moves ourselves?

117
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,182
Sure... As long as the
children like it, you

118
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:03,850
can change it as much
as you want.

119
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,686
You heard him...

120
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,422
What are you going
to do, Yuka?

121
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,292
How many minutes
do we have?

122
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,398
If you subtract the time to get
ready, we have thirty minutes left.

123
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,434
Junko...?

124
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,403
Help me.

125
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,011
From the top...

126
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,056
How about this?

127
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:48,494
That's cool!

128
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,232
What about this?

129
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,576
Moe! Your steps
are all wrong.

130
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,512
Do it like this...

131
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:28,866
It's time to get ready.

132
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,235
Standby...

133
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,738
Let's have fun, and dance.

134
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:40,544
Hello, everybody!

135
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:47,350
Where's your spirit?

136
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:50,920
Once more!

137
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:51,855
Hello!

138
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:53,690
Hello!

139
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,261
Well done!

140
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:03,866
You'll be seeing some fun
friends here on stage.

141
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,836
Let's all dance
together.

142
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:14,443
Here we go!

143
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,336
Those were the "Eyebrow cats".

144
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,873
Give them a hand, everyone!

145
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,444
Thank you, "Eyebrow cats".

146
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,629
It went pretty well, didn't it?

147
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,398
You made the wrong turn, Moe.

148
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,033
We need to practice.

149
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,603
That was wonderful!

150
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,805
The children loved it!

151
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,575
Just what you'd expect
from dancers.

152
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,177
I'm counting on you guys
for the next performance.

153
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:35,646
Take a break for an hour.

154
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,481
Here you go!

155
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:39,583
On the house!

156
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,054
It's warm.

157
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:47,524
Cheers!

158
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:56,466
After finishing the three
stage performances,

159
00:12:56,466 --> 00:13:00,103
thanks to the generosity
of the president, Hitomi

160
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:03,106
enjoyed a day at the
amusement park.

161
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:22,491
Hey! Keep moving!

162
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,093
I'm sorry...

163
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,795
I'm going. I'm sorry.

164
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,600
Naoko?

165
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,540
It's you!

166
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,260
Wait! What's wrong?

167
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,160
Don't tell Sano.

168
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:56,725
Goodbye.

169
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,500
Naoko!

170
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,600
What was Naoko doing
here anyway?

171
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,508
Here's your fee.

172
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,600
I even added a 1000 yen bonus.

173
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,080
If you don't mind, please
come and do it again.

174
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
Thank you for your
hard work today.

175
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,480
Thank you!

176
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,300
Shall we go?

177
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,961
Here you go...

178
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Thank you!

179
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,060
It's the first time she
got paid to dance.

180
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,270
While she savored the
happiness, she was

181
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,280
bothered about seeing Naoko
alone at the amusement park.

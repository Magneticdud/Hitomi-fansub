4
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,444
After the tenement's [block's] annual
flower viewing party, the

5
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,979
party continued over
at Rose's bar...

6
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,884
I think it's great

7
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,987
You're a really great
dancer, and you still

8
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,223
want to try something new

9
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,061
That might be over-exaggerating
a bit, but I wanted to do

10
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,430
something that's entirely
different from dancing.

11
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,867
What do you do, Keiko?

12
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,535
I'm a nurse

13
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,872
That must keep you 
busy, doesn't it?

14
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,274
But it's worthwhile

15
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,844
I feel like I'm being
of use to others

16
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,048
What about Keiko?

17
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,117
Are you kidding7

18
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,419
She's like my
little sister

19
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,156
But I think she's looking
for a more family type

20
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:08,126
of love... The love of an
older brother maybe

21
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,028
Excuse me for
a minute

22
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,198
What are you doing, Makoto?

23
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,433
What do you mean?

24
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,503
AY... I'll set it up. so
you can approach her

25
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,238
It's OK, never mind.

26
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,806
I want it to be
more natural.

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,773
Let him do it

28
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,275
Excuse me, Ray

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,877
Would you come and listen
to what my brother

30
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,278
has to say?

31
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,579
Sure

32
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,148
Thank you

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,016
Be careful

34
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,753
Let me introduce you..

35
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,722
This is my older brother

36
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,558
Thank you for coming
to cheer us on

37
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,460
You remembered?

38
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,995
Of course

39
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,130
I loved the way
you danced

40
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,799
Take a seat here.

41
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,635
I ove over there

42
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,403
Have a seat.

43
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,272
Thank you.

44
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,674
Stay

45
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,476
I'll just be in
the way

46
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,077
Stay here,
please!

47
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,516
Hey Keiko! Are you
drinking7

48
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,319
Ken and I were
just talking

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,354
About New York, and
things like that.

50
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,793
Do you go to the
clubs often?

51
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,062
Once in a while.

52
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,965
I've never gone to one.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
Take me the next
time you go

54
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,835
Let's go together,
Hitomi

55
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,837
Sure

56
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,839
What's wrong?

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,975
You seem depressed.

58
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,710
No, I'm not.

59
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,346
Then I'll go with
you too

60
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,015
Can you dance?

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,084
Of course I can!

62
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,986
I love to dance

63
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,521
I think he can

64
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,289
Since he's always
moving his body

65
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,591
Really?

66
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,392
See? The legendary
dancer says I can

67
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,827
I can dance. See?

68
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,571
Where's Hitomi?

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,908
I think she went into
the studio

70
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,011
She must be depressed,
after all

71
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,349
About Yuka and Junko
being scouted

72
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,952
I don't know how
to comfort her

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,873
Hitomi?

74
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,241
Mom!

75
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,618
I heard..

76
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,899
What are you going
to do from now?

77
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,306
Are you going to try again for
next year's Dance Beat?

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,277
I don't know

79
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,947
Then what are you
going to do?

80
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,582
You quit school
already

81
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,985
I'm still thinking
about it

82
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,325
Don't you want to
dance anymore7

83
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,194
Why?

84
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,397
Because you were the
only one left behind

85
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,901
I don't feel
like that

86
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,104
Yuka and Junko
are special

87
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,374
Then why are you
so depressed7

88
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,276
I'm not depressed

89
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,077
fes, you are.

90
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,244
No, I'm not!

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,163
I thought I gave it
all I had, and

92
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:09,434
I thought I had made up
the difference between

93
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:13,605
myself and Yuka and Junko ..

94
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,007
But I guess the people
watching could obviously

95
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,876
see the difference

96
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,015
I love dancing, but.

97
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,885
I was wondering
what's ahead

98
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,822
Is it going to end as
something that I just

99
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,359
enjoy doing for my own
self-satisfaction?

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,966
You don't want to do it just for
your own self-satisfaction?

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,037
I don't know.

102
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,808
I just don't know

103
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,981



104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,484
Then why don't you
quit dancing altogether?

105
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,487
It's better than being
half-hearted and just

106
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,189
dragging it out,
isn't it?

107
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,793
You're so cold, Mom!

108
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,695
I'm just giving
you advice

109
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,597
I thought if you chased
the idea of dancing out

110
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,066
of your head, you'll come
up with something

111
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,671
It's not that simple.

112
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,836
Are you awake?

113
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,737
Does it still hurt?

114
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,909
It's just as I thought
You tiori'i remember

115
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,645
On the way home from
Rose's place, you

116
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,214
fell down the stairs.

117
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,716
I did?

118
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,018
I'll come back to check on
you in a little while.

119
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,287
Keiko..?

120
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,025
You really seemed to be
enjoying yourself.

121
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,360
At R te s laeg..

122
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,096
With Ken..

123
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,706
We're dating.

124
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,176
What?

125
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,887
Keiko! What are
you doing?

126
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:44,890
What's with
you guys?

127
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:45,590
What's with
you guys?

128
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,327
Let go of me

129
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,599
Keiko! Keiko!

130
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,416
What's wrong with you?

131
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,018
Are you OK?

132
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,653
Sorry about that

133
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,721
It's nothing. I had a 
bad dream

134
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,959
That hurts

135
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,894
What is this?

136
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,863
Don't you remember?

137
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,532
You fell down at Rose's
place last night, and

138
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,501
hit your forehead, so
Keiko and Hitomi had

rljlj j) J i

140
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,039
They did?

141
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,113
Is that what Momoko's la?1

142
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,382
She says Slic"liars
things, doesn't she

143
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,952
It really got to me

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,557
But I don't think yo'^fe d
to fif^h into anything.

What do you think
about Keiko?

148
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,209
She's cheerful and knows
what she wants

149
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,611
And she's lite, too

150
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,579
Are you thinking
about dating her?

151
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,247
No, J'jp no

152
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,916
What's this all
about then?

153
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,918
At first glance, she's
cute. Then when you get

154
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,188
to know her, she's pretty
har and adorable

155
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,856
Hey Hitomi

156
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,958

Hello Ken

170
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,719
Hello, thanks for 
the other day

171
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,489
What, are you dating?

Were you OK
after that?

175
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,996
I guess so.

176
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,166
But it was fun,
wasn't it?

|.et£40 it again

178
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,472
Maybe it's better that
she wasn't scouted.

179
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,009

181
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,949
Hitomi's not suited
to a world like that

182
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,852
She always wants to get
along with others.

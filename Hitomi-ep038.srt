CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 38

2
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,607
They're holding
an audition...

3
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,143
The song will be the
d-Darts' debut song.

4
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,479
You can do it solo
or as a group.

5
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,381
The deciding battle
will be next Friday.

6
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,216
The place will be
Club BROCKS.

7
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,219
This is KEN, one of my
old dance partners.

8
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,489
He'll be in charge of
choreographing the

9
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,857
promotion video.

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,326
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you can do.

11
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,097
That's where you come in.
You're really tall.

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,532
You'll make a great weapon
when it comes to impact.

13
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,634
I'm a weapon?

14
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,513
Hitomi is full of enthusiasm
about the audition for

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,149
background dancers that
KEN will be judging.

16
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,100
Just as Hitomi is enthusiastic
about the audition, the

17
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:18,604
children are just as
enthusiastic about

18
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,506
helping her out.

19
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,077
My next mission is...

20
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,380
After the meal, I have to
clear the table.

21
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,554
Thank you for the meal.

22
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,090
So, who's washing
the dishes?

23
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,459
You and I are washing
the dishes, but Shota

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,294
will be taking the
dishes to the sink.

25
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,129
Roger!

26
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,539
If you pile them so high, you
won't be able to carry them.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,973
Sure, I can.

28
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,675
You don't have to carry
them all at one time.

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,410
I'm going to carry
them all at once.

30
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,745
Don't do it!

31
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,247
Look at that.

32
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,782
That's why I told you...

33
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,684
Why didn't you wake
me up, you idiot?

34
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,452
What is he doing so
early in the morning?

35
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,191
I know, but you could
have woken me up...

36
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,692
We live together!

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,563
All right. I'm on my way.
Let them wait.

38
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,302
Your storeroom blocks the
light, so I can't tell

39
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,770
what time it is!

40
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,638
Don't take it out on me.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,208
What's wrong with Yujiro?

42
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,643
He overslept.

43
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,314
Yuzo got up, and went to
Tsukiji without waking

44
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,016
him up, so he's
all upset.

45
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,658
You should think
about your age...

46
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,360
Be quiet!

47
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,795
That's what you get for staying up

48
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,929
until three in the morning.

49
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,798
Especially when you have to
work early in the morning.

50
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,733
Why did he stay up so late?

51
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,034
It's Mari...

52
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,936
Remember she invite him to
go somewhere faraway on

53
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,605
Sunday two weeks from now?

54
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,607
That's why he was looking
through the guidebooks

55
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,842
to find a place where they can go.

56
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,311
Is that why he was up until
three in the morning?

57
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,314
It's only a day trip, and he
was looking at Hakata.

58
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,483
If we take the Shinkansen,
we can go there, and eat

59
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,352
ramen noodles, and come back within a day.

60
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,954
If you go there, you'll have to
come right back, won't you?

61
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,324
Give me back the paper.

62
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,592
I want to read the
sports section.

63
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,427
I'm looking at the
culture section.

64
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,330
There's a special on
middle-aged couples' day off.

65
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,165
I've had enough of this!

66
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,700
You'll tear the paper!

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,703
Hello!

68
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,305
Mari!

69
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,407
I have to meet a friend,
so I just stopped by

70
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,276
to have a quick word with you
about where we're going.

71
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,112
You mean on our date?

72
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,347
How about Kamakura?

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,916
I was thinking the
same thing.

74
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,219
Here... I was reading
this article just now.

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,021
I read the same article.

76
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,956
That's why I thought of
going to Kamakura.

77
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,025
What a coincidence.

78
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,760
Do you think it's fate?

79
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,161
That's all I wanted to say.

80
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,596
We'll discuss the
details later.

81
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,930
Sorry to intrude.

82
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,799
See you later.

83
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,370
Kamakura... ?

84
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,540
That takes the cake!
I'm speechless.

85
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,242
Fate... ?

86
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,010
Kamakura...
Here we come!

87
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,613
Kamakura... Kamakura...

88
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,148
How shall we go?

89
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,698
Something's not right.

90
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,667
You think so?

91
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,438
Shall we change this part?

92
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,306
That's not the problem.

93
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,242
We just seem to be
unbalanced somehow.

94
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,612
But you're the one who
I'd make a good weapon.

95
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,816
At this rate,we won't
even reach the finals.

96
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,385
Maybe it was a mistake
to pair up with you.

97
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,054
Please don't say that now.

98
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,291
That's kind of harsh.

99
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,796
Hey, Junko...

100
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,034
If we're off balance, then
how about if we include

101
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,435
one more person?

102
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,141
Her?

103
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,711
That's impossible.

104
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,382
Not after I slapped
her the other day.

105
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,185
That's right. And doesn't
Yuka plan to do it alone?

106
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,154
Is that right?

107
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,724
Can you seduce her?

108
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,028
I'm asking you if you have
the confidence to convince

109
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,697
her to join us.

110
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,067
Confidence... ?

111
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,604
It's ok with me if
it's ok with you.

112
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,206
Go ahead, and convince her.

113
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,410
You'd better apologize
to her properly, Junko.

114
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,947
Self-presefvation
at all cost..

115
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,888
Junko... Do you
ave^ny savings?

116

117

120
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,140
About the audition...

any work anymore

218

That's enough, you two

230
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,274
You're drawing a crowd

231
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,244
You used to only talk about
our dried bonito Slakes,

232
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,179
or about our customers .
Now all you talk about

233
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,851
from morning until night
is Kamakura..* Kamakura!

234
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,519

It's about the future

00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,977
Our customers are all
Japanese-style and

247
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,181

class restaurants, so he was

own way, isn't he?

252
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,296
Being the idiot

That's right.

175
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,555
That's why I
reservations
at Makoto and Hiroshi's place

176
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,758
Yuka's a really nTi girt
so that's why I thought

177
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,661
monja' and a place like
this downtown area would

178
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,463
be something new to her

179
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,431
I'in sure she'll love it

180
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,301
n that case, fteryou
have ”m to a, ' Tiy don'

181
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,936
you bring or over he\?

182
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,706
So after you eat 'monja,
you can take a walk

183
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,509
around, and work up an
appetite, then bring

184
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,779

00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,122

Will you listen to this?

217
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,045
All my Idiot dad can think

00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,513
and he hardly does
any work anymore

219

one morning, and

220
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,349
that was because you
didn't wake me up

221
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,551
Why should I wake you up?

That's enough, you two

231
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,274
You're drawing a crowd

232
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,244
You used to only talk about
our dried bonito Slakes,

233
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,179
or about our customers .
Now all you talk about

234
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,851
from morning until night
is Kamakura..* Kamakura!

235
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,519

But he was saying something
about your customers

It's about the future

247
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,977
Our customers are all
Japanese-style and

248
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,181
old traditional style, high
class restaurants, so he was

00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,492
own way, isn't he?

253
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,296
Being the idiot

CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 38

2
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,280
They're holding
an audition...

3
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,820
The song will be the
d-Darts' debut song.

4
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,160
You can do it solo
or as a group.

5
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,090
The deciding battle
will be next Friday.

6
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,890
The place will be
Club BROCKS.

7
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,900
This is KEN, one of my
old dance partners.

8
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,170
He'll be in charge of
choreographing the

9
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,530
promotion video.

10
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you can do.

11
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,770
That's where you come in.
You're really tall.

12
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,210
You'll make a great weapon
when it comes to impact.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,310
I'm a weapon?

14
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,190
Hitomi is full of enthusiasm
about the audition for

15
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,820
background dancers that
KEN will be judging.

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,810
Just as Hitomi is enthusiastic
about the audition, the

17
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,280
children are just as
enthusiastic about

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,180
helping her out.

19
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,750
My next mission is...

20
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,090
After the meal, I have to
clear the table.

21
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,230
Thank you for the meal.

22
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,800
So, who's washing
the dishes?

23
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,130
You and I are washing
the dishes, but Shota

24
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,970
will be taking the
dishes to the sink.

25
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,800
Roger!

26
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,210
If you pile them so high, you
won't be able to carry them.

27
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,680
Sure, I can.

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,350
You don't have to carry
them all at one time.

29
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm going to carry
them all at once.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,420
Don't do it!

31
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,920
Look at that.

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,490
That's why I told you...

33
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,390
Why didn't you wake
me up, you idiot?

34
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,160
What is he doing so
early in the morning?

35
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,900
I know, but you could
have woken me up...

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,400
We live together!

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,270
All right. I'm on my way.
Let them wait.

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,010
Your storeroom blocks the
light, so I can't tell

39
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,480
what time it is!

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,310
Don't take it out on me.

41
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,880
What's wrong with Yujiro?

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,350
He overslept.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,020
Yuzo got up, and went to
Tsukiji without waking

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,690
him up, so he's
all upset.

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,330
You should think
about your age...

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,070
Be quiet!

47
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,500
That's what you get for staying up

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,600
until three in the morning.

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,470
Especially when you have to
work early in the morning.

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,440
Why did he stay up so late?

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,740
It's Mari...

52
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,640
Remember she invite him to
go somewhere faraway on

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,310
Sunday two weeks from now?

54
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,310
That's why he was looking
through the guidebooks

55
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,550
to find a place where they can go.

56
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,020
Is that why he was up until
three in the morning?

57
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
It's only a day trip, and he
was looking at Hakata.

58
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,190
If we take the Shinkansen,
we can go there, and eat

59
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,060
ramen noodles, and come back within a day.

60
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,660
If you go there, you'll have to
come right back, won't you?

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,030
Give me back the paper.

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,300
I want to read the
sports section.

63
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm looking at the
culture section.

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,030
There's a special on
middle-aged couples' day off.

65
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,870
I've had enough of this!

66
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,400
You'll tear the paper!

67
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,410
Hello!

68
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,010
Mari!

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,110
I have to meet a friend,
so I just stopped by

70
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,980
to have a quick word with you
about where we're going.

71
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,820
You mean on our date?

72
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,050
How about Kamakura?

73
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,620
I was thinking the
same thing.

74
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,890
Here... I was reading
this article just now.

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
I read the same article.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,660
That's why I thought of
going to Kamakura.

77
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,730
What a coincidence.

78
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,460
Do you think it's fate?

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,860
That's all I wanted to say.

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,300
We'll discuss the
details later.

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,630
Sorry to intrude.

82
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,470
See you later.

83
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,070
Kamakura... ?

84
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,240
That takes the cake!
I'm speechless.

85
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,940
Fate... ?

86
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,710
Kamakura...
Here we come!

87
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,320
Kamakura... Kamakura...

88
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,850
How shall we go?

89
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,400
Something's not right.

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,370
You think so?

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Shall we change this part?

92
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,010
That's not the problem.

93
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,940
We just seem to be
unbalanced somehow.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,310
But you're the one who
I'd make a good weapon.

95
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,520
At this rate,we won't
even reach the finals.

96
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,090
Maybe it was a mistake
to pair up with you.

97
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,760
Please don't say that now.

98
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,990
That's kind of harsh.

99
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,500
Hey, Junko...

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,730
If we're off balance, then
how about if we include

101
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,140
one more person?

102
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,840
Her?

103
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,410
That's impossible.

104
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,080
Not after I slapped
her the other day.

105
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,890
That's right. And doesn't
Yuka plan to do it alone?

106
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,850
Is that right?

107
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,420
Can you seduce her?

108
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,730
I'm asking you if you have
the confidence to convince

109
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,400
her to join us.

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,770
Confidence... ?

111
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,300
It's ok with me if
it's ok with you.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,910
Go ahead, and convince her.

113
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,110
You'd better apologize
to her properly, Junko.

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,650
"Self-preservation
at all cost..."?

115
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,590
Junko... Do you
have any savings?

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,460
I work part-time, so
I have a little bit.

117
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,560
Why?

118
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,430
The best way to a woman's
heart is food, isn't it?

119
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,860
Yuka!

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,840
About the audition...

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Won't you join
me and Junko?

122
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,010
I'll pass...

123
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm going to
dance alone.

124
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,810
Won't you think about it?

125
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,950
We already have some
of the steps...

126
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,690
Then show it to me.

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,410
That's not my style
of dancing...

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,740
In other words,
it won't work.

129
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,480
Then join us, and
make it work.

130
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,650
Besides, you and I don't
even get along, do we?

131
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,010
I don't want to end up
fighting with you like

132
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,010
the last time.

133
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,080
Can't you just
think about it?

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,290
This time, Junko said she's
willing to use a lot of

135
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,050
your ideas... Didn't you?

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,560
Can we just talk about it?

137
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,130
We can talk while eat.

138
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,330
It's Junko's treat!

139
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,270
We could have steak, shabu
shabu or sushi.

140
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,170
We could even have
pot stew...!

141
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,300
We could go to a high-class
Japanese-style restaurant.

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,640
What do you like
to eat, Yuka?

143
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,580
I knew it wouldn't work
from the beginning.

144
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,220
For one thing, Yuka's father
owns dozens of restaurants,

145
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,750
so she's probably eaten
steak, shabu shabu or

146
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,620
Italian until she's
tired of them.

147
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,490
That's true, but...

148
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,690
That would catch my
attention right away.

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,830
Then maybe beef bowl or
ramen noodles might work.

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
Maybe it'll be so unusual,
it'll grab her attention.

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,170
But we'll finish eating
in five minutes.

152
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,070
We won't be able to talk.

153
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,940
Hitomi... How about "that"?

154
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,280
You know... What we
had the other day.

155
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,250
Oh, "that"?

156
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,360
Yuka!

157
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,030
You're so persistent!
Don't bother me.

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,230
We don't have any lesson
tomorrow, do we?

159
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,630
So what about it?

160
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,800
Would you like to come to
Tsukishima and have "monja"?

161
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,500
"Monja"?

162
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,900
That's right... "Monja.”

163
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,070
I've heard of it.

164
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,440
You fry it on an
iron griddle.

165
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,140
You mean "okonomiyaki"?

166
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,440
No... it's different.

167
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,010
It's not quite as
well-done.

168
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,580
The feel of it in your
mouth is something

169
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,250
that's beyond comparison.
Isn't it?

170
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,920
I think I might like
to try it.

171
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,160
Maybe I'll go
with you.

172
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,010
So, you're going to bring Yuka
and the others to eat "monja"?

173
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,710
That's right.

174
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,250
That's why I made reservations
at Makoto and Hiroshi's place.

175
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,450
Yuka's a really rich girl
so that's why I thought

176
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,350
"monja" and a place like
this downtown area would

177
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,150
be something new to her.

178
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm sure she'll love it.

179
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,990
In that case, after you
have "monja", why don't

180
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,630
you bring her over here?

181
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,400
So after you eat "monja",
you can take a walk

182
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,200
around, and work up an
appetite, then bring

183
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,470
her over here, and we can
have pot stew together.

184
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,310
I'm all for pot stew!

185
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,540
Me, too!

186
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,010
Really?

187
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,940
Then I'll have to shop at Tsukiji tomorrow...

188
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,250
Why do you put in "yosenabe"
pot stew anyway?

189
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,080
You should ask Yuzo
about that.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,020
Knows a lot of cheap
and delicious places

191
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,120
to buy food.

192
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
You're right.
I'm all for that.

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,090
Me, too!

194
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,190
In that case, shall we invite
Yujiro and Ume, too?

195
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,260
I'm all for Yujiro
and Ume, too!

196
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,360
We'll do that then.

197
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,830
I've had enough already!

198
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,530
Act your age!

199
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,540
Is that Yuzo?

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,710
And Yujiro?

201
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,170
What's going on anyway?

202
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,470
What are they
fighting about?

203
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,940
All you talk about is
Kamakura... Kamakura

204
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,180
from morning until night.

205
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,810
Buying all these guidebooks.

206
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,580
What are you going to
do with all of them?

207
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,880
And who is this Gen Raicho?

208
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,390
It's Minamoto no Yoritomo!

Gen Raicho/Minamoto Yoritomo

209
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,420
He's the founder of the
Kamakura shogunate.

210
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,390
While we're on our date, that
topic might come up, so

211
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,360
I have to study up on it.

212
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,660
You're really having an
academic discussion here...

213
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,800
Talking about the Kamakura
shogunate and stuff like that.

214
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,170
Will you listen to this?

215
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,730
All my idiot dad can think
about, is his date with Mari

216
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,200
and he hardly does
any work anymore.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,470
I was late just that
one morning, and

218
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,040
that was because you
didn't wake me up.

219
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,240
Why should I wake you up?

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,710
Ail you think about is your date.

221
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,210
What? Are you against
my dating Mari?

222
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,610
What do you mean "date"?

223
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,080
You're not a young kid.

224
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,150
My heart is as pure
as a young kid.

225
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,420
Have you looked at your
face lately? You look

226
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,090
like a pigeon that's been
shot with a peashooter.

227
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,260
Say that again!

228
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,430
That's enough, you two.

229
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,960
You're drawing a crowd.

230
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,930
You used to only talk about
our dried bonito flakes,

231
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,870
or about our customers...
Now all you talk about

232
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,540
from morning until night
is Kamakura... Kamakura!

233
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,210
I can't take it anymore.

234
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,110
Yuzo!

235
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,080
Yuzo...?

236
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,050
Did you hear that!

237
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,480
Lecturing his own
dad like that.

238
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,150
Shall I go, and
check on him?

239
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,350
Go after him.

240
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,050
Yujiro?

241
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,350
Aren't things going well
with your business?

242
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,790
No... we're doing fine.

243
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,190
But he was saying something
about your customers...

244
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,430
It's about the future...

245
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,660
Our customers are all
Japanese-style and

246
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,870
old traditional style, high
class restaurants, so he was

247
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,240
telling me to look at the
newer restaurants that

248
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,310
emphasize the taste of food.

249
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,910
I see... Yuzo's thinking
about the future in his

250
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,180
own way, isn't he?

251
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,980
Being the idiot
that he is...

252
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,050
Sorry about the commotion.

253
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,450
Good night.

254
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,070
I've only seen him as man whose
mind is always on work,

255
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,000
so it throws me off.

256
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,670
Seeing him getting so caught up
in something else like this.

257
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
It's a good thing...

258
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,970
Age doesn't matter when it
comes to falling in love.

259
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,440
Why can't you just
indulge him?

260
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,140
It's not that I'm against it.

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,210
I almost forgot... Will you
help me go shopping in

262
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,450
Tsukiji tomorrow?

263
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,850
We're thinking of having
a pot stew party at home.

264
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm going to invite some
friends from dance school.

265
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,090
Dance school?

266
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,790
I don't have time for that.

267
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,720
It's probably some of those
good-looking guys who

268
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,830
can dance like this...

269
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,230
I don't want to help.

270
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,200
I see! That's ok then.

271
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,330
They're all girls...
Three of them.

272
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,570
What did you
just say?

273
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,570
Gather around. Come on.
Gather around.

274
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,170
One...

275
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,510
...two ...three.

276
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,310
We have just enough to have
a "gokon" (co-ed party).

277
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,710
What are you saying?

278
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,250
Let's do it.

279
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,250
No! We're not having
a "gokon" party.

280
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,960
The next day, Yuka and the
others came to Tsukishima.

281
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,170
Will Hitomi's strategy to
convince Yuka work?

282
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,170
To be continued...

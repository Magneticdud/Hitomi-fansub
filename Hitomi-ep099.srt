00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,041
Hitomi and Junko were in
Utsunomiya to visit

7
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,878
Junko's mother who had been
in an automobile accident.

8
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,980
Don't say that..

9
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,549
Just think about
getting better

10
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,385
Aren't you glad that all
you have to do is stay

11
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,187
in bed to get better?

12
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,888
I wonder if it was the
traffic safety amulet

13
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,623
that we got at New Year's
that worked

14
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,127
It didn't work! That's why
I phlli

15
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,795
You're right

16
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,834
I brought her

17
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,672
This is Hitomi, the friend
I just told you about.

18
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,442
Thank you for coming all
the way here.

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,745
Dont move! You're
making me sore

20
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,548
Please don't get up.

21
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,950
I'm sorry...

22
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:58,484
I'm sorry...

23
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,755
I'm glad it wasn't
serious.

24
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,891
I just have to stay
in the hospital for

25
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,925
about two weeks

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,627
Is that right?

27
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,029
Dad bought tea

28
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,432
I bought bean jam cakes,
and rice balls, too

29
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,067
You're going to spend the
night here, aren't you?

30
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,268
You can have
a late night snack.

31
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,169
Thanks

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,670
Didn't •.'<)« .;ar to
work overtime?

33
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,506
At a time like this, I have
to do my job as the eldest

34
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,242
son since my little sister is
too busy with her dancing

35
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,246
I'd better be going.

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,015
e IngJiome?

37
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,884
Are the trains
still running?

38
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,352
No, please stay

39
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,953
e ad f We TTt
go home this late

40
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,889
e ake hfcr on
he axi. Keiichi.

41
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,123
Please stay

42
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,160
OK... I'll take you up
on your kind offer

43
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,866
Hashimoto Gyoza

44
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,468
The name of our restaurant
has our last name in it,

45
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,669
doesn't it?

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,838
When I was in grade school,
there was a mean boy who

47
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,040
to T< my-name, Hashimoto
Junko, and he erased

48
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:02,814
-*he-3Hh" from my name, and
turned it into "gyoza"

49
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,486
Hashimoto Gyoza

50
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,823
Things like that happened
but I have to admit that

51
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,759
our gyoza are delicious

52
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,128
There are a lot of places
with delicious gyoza,

53
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,996
but I like ours the best

54
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,599
Everything is
made by hand

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,768
My dad wakes up when it's
still dark, and he starts

56
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,369
by making the wrappers

57
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,705
He had someone helping
him, but he said his

58
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,408
work was sloppy, so
he fired him

59
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,177
He's a real craftsman,
isn't he?

60
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,979
That's right,
He's stubborn.

61
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,348
When I quit my job as an
office clerk to go to

62
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,050
Tokyo, we had a big fight

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,851
He told me, "Are you
planning to become

64
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,687
a dancer or some
such nonsense?"

65
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,756
But now he

66
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,558
41 3.JVJ
Ill I f

67
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,261
The gyoza keep
us connected

68
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,763
As long as I eat gyoza,
I'm still his daughter

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,934
Junko... Won't you come here
and have some beer?

70
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,302
You, too, Hitomi

71
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,137
Is it OK?

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,708
Shall we make gyoza?

73
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,646
Do we have any?
Yes, we do!

74
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,513
Really?

75
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,682
We have all the ingredients.
Give me a hand.

76
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,783
S t 1(3

77
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,184
Is it OK?

78
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,418
Why not?

79
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,820
Shall we make some?

80
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,988
Really?

81
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,058
This feels good.

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,027
Be sure it's
saning up

83
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,429
OK...is this OK?

84
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,530
It'll pass

85
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,969
Hand me a plate, please

86
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,707
This is great!

87
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,376
Here you go

88
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,285
What's going to happen if
you appear on Dance Beat?

89
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,422
It's not that anything
will happen, but it's

90
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,692
the goal of all the
dancers in Japan

91
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,895
Will you earn a lot
of money if you do?

92
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,197
Not really

93
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,666
It s like the "Koshien"
high school baseball

94
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,268
championship... You don't
work hard for the money

95
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,037
It's not like the "Koshien"

96
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,506
If you win the Koshien,
everyone will say how

97
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,441
great you are

98
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,077
But no one knows what
Dance Beat is

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,980
Even if you won, it wouldn't
be anything to brag about

100
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,915
around here, would it

101
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,551
I'm not doing it so I can
brag to the neighbors

102
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,153
It might be OK for you

103
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,355
You're doing it for your
own self-satisfaction,

104
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,657
but you're putting
Mom in a bind

105
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,592
When the neighbors ask
what happened to you

106
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,661
since you went to Tokyo

107
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,097
She can't say anything

108
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,833
If you could at least come
out on TV

109
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,201
When are you going to
appear on TV?

110
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,235
I don't know

111
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,770
Hurry and make an appearance
even if it's just as a

112
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,372
background dancer

113
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,541
You're putting us in an
embarrassing position.

114
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,042
It has nothing to do
with you, does it?

115
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,944
Of course it does

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,183
All you've ever done is
make the family worry

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,120
When she was in high school,
she went astray and

118
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,290
went around with some ladies
motorcycle gang

119
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,794
Going out with some
weird characters..

120
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,597
You'd look like this
or like this

121
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,368
Mom and Dad cried and
begged her to at least

122
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,105
find a decent full time
job, so she found a job

123
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,275
as an office clerk.

124
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,880
Everyone was so
relieved

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,450
Then she suddenly decided
she wanted to go to Tokyo,

126
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,352
and become a dancer

127
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,121
What was that anyway?

128
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,690
Ever since I was little,
I loved watching

129
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,625
dancers on television.

130
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,295
She's always talking
nonsense like that!

131
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,032
What's going to happen
to this restaurant?

132
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,702
The way Dad and Mom are
now, they can't go on

133
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,338
like this much longer.

134
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,974
They'll have no choice
but to lose it

135
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,009
Dad must be so frustrated
that the business that

136
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,744
his parents handed down
to him wont go any

137
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,045
further than his
generation...

138
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,914
Wait a minute, why do you
make it sound as if it

139
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,449
has nothing to
do with you?

140
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,251
Aren't you the one who's
supposed to be thinking

141
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,420
about what happens
to this shop?

142
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,754
Are you telling me
to take it over?

143
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,189
You're the eldest
son, aren t you?

144
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,590
You take it over

145
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,492
versinc ot a job at
hefcan , bad thought

146
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,061
\ rott

ere going to
a*e over e business

147
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,963
don't know anything
about that

148
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,665
V\/h hy fi were in high school,
Ve 'hde'y W help him make

149
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,634
the gyoza wrappers

150
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,935
as a part-time job

151
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,404
Dad was training you!

152
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,842
And trying to straighten
you out at the same time.

153
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,111
He thought you'd eventually
marry someone from around

154
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,180
here and take over
the business

155
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,583
You're trampling all over
his hopes

156
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,826
But he supports Junko in
what she's doing now

157
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,195
Every so often, ver
to Junko's place to eat

158
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,464
the gyoza that he
sends to her.

159
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,232
He's just trying to make
sure Junko doesn't forget

160
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,934
about gyoza completely

161
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,735
He's trying to tell you
to come home someday

162
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,737
and make the gyoza
in his place

163
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,774
I wonder about that..

164
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,908
You wouidn't understand.

165
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,743
Even Junko doesn't
realize it

166
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,880
What I said earlier..
I wasn't kidding!

167
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,049
Mom's really worried
about you

168
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,452
About Dad and about
the restaurant, too

169
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,121
Are you telling me
to quit dancing?

170
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,624
It's a lot easier than
my quitting the bank!

171
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,227
The bank may be important
to you, but dancing is

172
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,229
just as important to me!

173
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,698
Society doesn't
see it that way

174
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,566
The bank is 1 ."bo times
more important than

175
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,101
your dancing!

176
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,070
It's no use talking
to you!

177
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,073
Junko!

178
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,543
Let her be.

179
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,248
To be honest, I have no idea
what she wants to do!

180
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,251
Do you?

181
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,125
In any case, dancing is fun

182
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,361
Putting aside things like
making money, becoming

183
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,630
famous or coming out on
TV, it's a way

184
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,164
that you can express
yourself, an

185
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,434
You can do that by going to
sing at a "karaoke" room

186
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,506
I'm trying to tell you
it's not like that!

187
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,577
I don't understand
you either

188
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,146
I have no idea what goes
on in the minds of

189
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,781
people who are dancers

190
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,990
Junko?

191
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,663
Why does my brother have
to say things like that

192
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,865
about me anyway?

193
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,303
I do think about the
business and I'm

194
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,608
worried about my parents,
too, but I wanted to

195
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,376
go to Tokyo

196
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,014
I wanted to see how
far I could go

197
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,154
Is it impossible?

198
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,866
Junko.

199
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,507
Hitomi is good at looking
after people, isn't she?

200
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,276
She went all the way to her
friend's family home.

201
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,178
When she gets it in her
head to do something,

202
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,947
she just does it.

203
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,915
I guess you could say it's
a bad habit of hers.

204
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,317
but it's a good thing

205
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,285
Being there for
her friend

206
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,488
That's the beauty
of youth

207
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,758
It sends chills up my spine**
when you talk about youth.

208
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,793
I can see the moid
jgf wing on it

209
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,195
Running around for the
sake of a friend

210
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,965
They really are the days of
her youth, aren't they?

211
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,367
Aren't they? I'd like to
go back to that time

212
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,102
Me, too

213
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,905
Excuse me

214
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,840
Come back over here

215
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,742
Come back from
e oast

216
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,219
He didn't have to say
those things to you

217
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,921
He's too selfish.

218
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,792
Putting all the responsibility
on your shoulders like that.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,429
He's just getting
carried away.

220
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,266
Just because he got a job at
the bank, and has a beautiful

221
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:46,304
wife, he thinks he's
something else.

222
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,545
He doesn't understand...
You shouldn't let what

223
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,714
he says bother you

224
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,519
But I'm already 21

225
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,556
It may be too late for me
to make a debut.

226
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,665
I wonder if my mom is
that worried about me

227
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,339
If I don't take it over,
they'll have to shut

228
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,775
down this restaurant,
won't they?

229
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,185
Good night.

230
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,380
Is that right? You ate
our gyoza before?

231
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,717
Wher'eve lTjoo/er
I ate

232
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,821
I 'm IWay scorned If she's

233
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,258
After all gyoza is a

234
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,293
completely nutritious food

235
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,197
It has vegetables, garlic
i ler nqr Clients

236
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,065
<s we l-i) danced

237
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,334
t omes in h Yicty
Thank you

238
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,503
If her friends are eating
too, we better send

239
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,005
a whole box

240
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,073
It won't fit in
my refrigerator

241
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,511


242
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,246
When you got into
the accident

243
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,781
/hat s t

244
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,150
Was it because you e
ui yio aujo

245
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,252
Of course not

246
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,555
Are you sure?

247
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,291
Then were you worrying
the business?

248
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,627
Thinking that Keiihi and
o take over f Y you?

249
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,897
You don't have to 
worry about it

250
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,301
^ a such a nice day
as n a

251
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,403
fiat' t is.

252
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,541
Don't worry about it, and
just do your best

253
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,410
for dancing.

254
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,746
That's right

255
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,249
After all, you have such
a good friend like Hitomi

256
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,184
Doesn't she

257
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,723
It makes it even harder
for me when they say

258
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,458
things like that

259
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,694
Since they're giving you
their support, let's

260
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,129
do our best to get
into Dance Beat

261
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,966
In any case, I'm not going
to dance class today.

262
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,136
But if we go back to Tokyo
now, we can make it in time.

263
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,639
I'm just not in the
mood to dance.

264
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,675
I'm wondering if I should
even be doing this

265
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,980
Don't say the same
thing as Yuka

266
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,050
Forgive me if I don't say
anything on the train back.

267
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,688
Junko...

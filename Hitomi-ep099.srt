Hashimoto Gyoza

44
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,468
The name of our restaurant
has our last name in it,

45
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,669
doesn't it?

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,838
When I was in grade school,
there was a mean boy ^vho

47
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,040
to T< my-name, Hashimoto
Junko, and he erased

48
00:02:55,041 --> 00:03:02,814
-*he-3Hh" from my name, and
turned it into "gyoza"

49
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,486
Hashimoto Gyoza

50
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,823
J*|iings like that happened
b 11 "have to admit that

51
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,759
our "gyoza'Uis delicious

52
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,128

ut J like ours the best

54
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,599
Everything is
made bv hand

55
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,768
My dad wakes up when it's
still dark, and he starts

56
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,369
by making the wrappers

57
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,705
He had Someone^helping
hirh-but he said his

58
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,408
4^ork was sloppy, n
he fired mm

59
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,177
He's a real craftsman,
isn't heV

60
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,979
That's right
He's stubborn.

61
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,348
Vhen I quit my job as an
office clerk to go to

62
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,050
Tokyo, we had a big fight

63
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,851
He told pie, "Are you
pla Tung to become

64
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,687
a dande. or some
such nonsense?"

65
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,756
But now he

83
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,429
Okay Is Tiisokay9

84
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,530
It'll pass

85
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,969
Hand me a plate, olease

86
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,707
This is great*

87
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,376
Here you go

88
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,285
What's going to jiappen if
you appear on Dance Beat9

89
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,422
it's not that anything
will happen, but it's

90
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,692
the goal of all the
dancers m Japan

91
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,895
Will you earn a lot
of money if you do9

92
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,197
Mot really

93
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,666
It s like the "Koshien"
high school baseball

94
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,268
championship... You don't
work hard for the money

95
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,037
It s not like the "Koshien"

96
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,506
If you win the Koshien,"
ever/one will say how

97
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,441
great you are

98
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,077
But no one knows what
Dance Beat is

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,980
Even if you won, it wouldn't
be anything to brag about

100
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,915
around nere, would

101
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,551
I'm not doing It so I can
brag to the neighbors

102
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,153
It might okay for you

103
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,355
You're doing it for your
own self-satisfaction,

104
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,657
but you're putting
Mom in a bind

105
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,592
When the neighbors ask
what happened to you

106
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,661
since you went to Tokyo

107
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,097
She can't say anything

108
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,833
If you could at least come
out on television

109
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,201
When are ^ou going to
appear on television?

110
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,235
I don't know

111
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,770
Hurry, ahc! make an appearance
even fa it's just as^a

112
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,372
b Aground d >iter

113
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,541
You're putting us in an
mbarrassing oosition.

114
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,042
It has nothing to do
with you, does jt?

115
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,944
Of course it o


116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,183
All y u've ever done is
make the family worry

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,120
When she was in high school,
she went astray and

118
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,290
went around with some ladies
motorcycle gang

119
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,794
Going out with some
//eird characters..

120
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,597
Y'fy look& like this
Or like this*

121
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,368
Mom an 'iDad cried, and
begged her o t ieast

122
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,105
finflAscent full time
job, so l^e found a job

123
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,275
as an office clerk.

124
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,880
Everyone was so
relieved

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,450
Then she suddenly decided
she wanted to go to Tokyo,

126
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,352
and become p dancer

127
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,121
Nhat was that anyway9

128
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,690
Ever incfe I was little,
lised to love watching

129
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,625
^ dancers on television.

130
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,295
She's always talking
nonsense like that1

131
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,032
What's going to happen
to this restaurant. 9

132
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,702
The way Dad and Mom are

134

£8lHUDip

150
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,935
As a part-time job

151
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,404
Dad was raining ou!

152
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,842
And trying to straighten
you out at the same time.

153
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,111
He thought you'd eventually
marry someone from around

154
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,180
h >e, and take over
the business

155
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,583
You re tram ling all over
hisfcopesan^rW

156
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,826
But he supports Junko n
what "he's doing no&

157
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,195
very so often, ver
o Junko's plac o t

158
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,464
the "gyoza" that he
sends to her.

159
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,232
He's justifying to make
^ure Junko doesn't forget

160
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,934
about "gyoza'' completely

161
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,735
He's rying to tell you
to cOi^ home someday,

162
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,737
and make the "gyoza"
in his place

163
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,774
I wonder about that..

164
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,908
You wouidn t understand.

165
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,743
Even Junko doesn't
realize it

166
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,880
Wh \ I said earlier..
I wasn't kidding!

167
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,049
^Uom s really worried
about you

168
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,452
About Dad and a "but
the restaurant, too

169
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,121
Are you telling me
to quit dancing9

170
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,624
It's a lot aasiet t^n
my quitfing the bank!

171
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,227
The bank may be important
to you, but dancing is

172
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,229
just as important to me'

173
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,698
ociety doesn't
see it that way

174

Junko'

178
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,543
Let hert>e.

179
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,248
To be hohest, I have no idea
what she wants to do!

180
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,251
Do you9

181
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,125
in any case, dancing s fun

182
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,361
Putting aside things ike
making money, becoming

183
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,630
famous or coming out on
television, it's a way

184
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,164
that you can express

yourseii, an

185
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,434
Yo an do that by_golng to
sing at a "karaoke" room

186
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:01,506
I'm trying to tell you
It's not like that!

187
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,577
I don't understand
yo1 ^lther

188
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,146
I have no idea a oes

189

people who are a c s

190

Junko 9

191
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,663
Why does my brother have
to say things like that

192
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,865
about me anyway9

193
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,303
I do think about the
business and I'm

194
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,608
worried about my parents,
too, but J wanted to

195
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,376
go to Tokyo

196
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,014
I wanted to see how
far i could go

197
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,154
Is it impossible9

198
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,866
Junko.

199
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,507
Hitomi is good at looking
after people, isn t she?

200
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,276
She' e all the way to her
frien 's familytiome.

201
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,178
When she gets it in her
head to do something.

202
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,947
she just does it.

203
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,915
I guess you could say it's
a bad habit of hers.

204
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,317
WSId^ts a good thing

205
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,285

00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,793
I can see the moid
jgf wing on it

209
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,195
Running arohnd for the
sake of a frien

210
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,965
it really js the days of
her you sn't it?

211
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,367
Isn't it? I d like to
go back to that time

212
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,102

Come back from

216
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,219
He didn't have to say
those things to /ou

217
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,921
He s too selfish.

218
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,792
Putting all the responsibility
on your shoulders like that.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,429
He s just getting
carried away.

220
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,266
Just because he got a job at
the bank, and has a beautiful

221
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:46,304
wife, he thinks he s
something else.

222
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,545
He doesn't understand...
You shouldn't let what

223
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,714
he says bother you

224
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,519
But I'm already 21

225
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,556
it may be too late for me
to make a debut.

226
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,665
wonder if my mom is
that worried about me

227
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,339
f1 don't take it over,
they'll have to shut

won't they?

229
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,185

After all, you have such
a good friend like Hitomi

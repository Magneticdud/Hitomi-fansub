CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 65

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,409
After having too much to
drink at Rose's bar

3
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,678
Momoko spent the night
at the Ippongi home.

4
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,205
What happened?

5
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,410
It's late, so why don't you
spend the night here?

6
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,115
Maybe I should

7
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,718
You scared me.

8
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,191
Cheers!

9
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,669
Do you remember what
you said earlier?

10
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,473
What you said at
Rose's place.

11
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,646
I can't remember at all
What did I say?

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,185
You said you ran off to
get married, left home

13
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,421
and threw everything away,
but you don't regret it

14
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,959
I may have exaggerated
it a little

15
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,328
There's one thing
I regret

16
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,465
Is it about Grandma?

17
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,771
I made her sad until
the day she died

18
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,909
She was caught between
me and Dad...and

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,546
I wish she could have
seen more of you

20
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,617
But I can't do anything
about it anymore.

21
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,687
You can do something
about it now

22
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,856
Just make up with Grandpa

23
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,559
I think that would make
Grandma happy

24
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,994
It's not that easy.

25
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,729
Why not?

26
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,832
You both just have to be
honest with each other

27
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,871
If so, I would wonder
why I made Mom so sad

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,941
for over 20 years

29
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,947
I think Dad feels
the same way.

30
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:44,256
It's going to take time
to melt the ice that's

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,825
been building up
for 20 years

32
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,668
Hitomi

33
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,239
Look the other way...

34
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,544
I'm going to cry

35
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,675
Thicken up.. Thicker!
Thicker!

36
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,916
I'll bet you're surprised that
I'm still here, aren't you?

37
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,486
You can't avoid me

38
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,424
I'm going to try to
get along with you

39
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,794
Otherwise, I won't be able
to help out here, will I?

40
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,163
I'm coming
again tonight

41
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,301
Let's eat!

42
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,145
Break's over

43
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,484
This time, I'll have you
dance one by one

44
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,922
If you don't try something
new, you won't be ready

45
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,957
to move on to the next step

46
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,031
Let's start with Hitomi

47
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,420
While she danced, Momoko's
words kept running through

48
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,288
Hitomi's head

49
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,492
It's your life

50
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,030
Decide what you want to
do with your dancing

51
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,803
That charge - to find

52
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,240
what she wanted to
do with her life

53
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,481
That's pretty heavy

54
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,583
Even when she's drunk.
your mom says some

55
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,252
profound things,
doesn't she?

56
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,921
She's more profound
when she's drunk.

57
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,157
She normally doesn't
say things like that

58
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,225
So what are you
going to do?

59
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,595
I don't know but I thought
I'd start something.

60
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,798
Like what?

61
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,169
That's why... I'll start
something that shows

62
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,705
that I'm moving ahead

63
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,543
Even if you say that...

64
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,281
This is it! The summer
dance contest

65
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,151
I'm going to get the
500,000 yen prize

66
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,455
I'm going to talk to
Yuka and Junko

67
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,994
I already told you
about that!

68
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,532
You might as well confess!
I have the proof.

69
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,801
Yuka

70
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,870
What?

71
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,738
Are you looking
for a fight?

72
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,475
Let's not fight

73
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,743
Do you want to
enter this?

74
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,313
The Summer Dance Contest?

75
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,181
We can form a unit
and enter it...

76
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,583
I'll be the manager

77
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,550
I won't do it

78
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,052
Not with this
selfish girl!

79
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,787
I won't do it either!

80
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,756
Did something happen?

81
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,324
Crab! The crab

82
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,191
Crab! The crab

83
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,659
Crab?

84
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,263
We both chip in for food,
so we can eat at home

85
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,765
The standard menu is
gyoza (potstickersj

86
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,002
The gyoza that Junko's
family sends to her

87
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,338
The rest, I try to juggle the
finances by going to

88
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,306
the market right before
closing, so I can buy

89
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,075
vegetables at half price...

90
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,877
But it would be kind of
boring if we only had that

91
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,413
So we decided to
splurge once in a while.

92
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,515
That's the crab?

93
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,216
That's right..
Crab

94
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,818
We ate half last week,
and we agreed

95
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,653
to eat the rest on Sunday.

96
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,189
But she ate it all
by herself!

97
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,092
You ate it, didn't you?

98
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
It was you, wasn't it?

99
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,697
Admit it! You ate it!
I saw that!

100
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,766
It was you!

101
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,935
Why did you do that?

102
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,372
When was alone in the
apartment I started

103
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,940
to feel miserable

104
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,778
I never have any money, and
there's no excitement.

105
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,815
So I thought I'd just
eat it all up

106
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,785
You're just a little
rich girl, after all.

107
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,954
You can't live without
being extravagant

108
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,757
It's your fault for
being so unrefined!

109
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,125
What?

110
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,927
Do you know what she does?

111
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,195
She walks around the place
munching on rice crackers

112
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,865
So the whole place is covered
with cracker crumbs!

113
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,200
It make me feel even
more miserable

114
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,269
When you notice crumbs,
clean them up

115
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,938
Noticing them makes
me mad!

116
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,606
Calm down

117
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,075
Let's stop a boring 
fight

118
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,544
Look at this
500,000 yen!

119
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,046
Let's go for
the gusto!

120
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,280
Why are you so
fired up?

121
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,582
Why are you so
fired up?

122
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,885
We've been in dance class
for four months already

123
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,853


124
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,056
And we're so caught up
with school, our jobs

125
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,558
and problems at home that
we're not making our

126
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,293
own dance yet

127
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,432
I think that's why you
feel so miserable.

128
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,536
You haven't done your own thing
yet, so you're starting

129
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,004
to get impatient.

130
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,940
To be honest, I'm getting
impatient too

131
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,775
I want to go on
Dance Beat but I

132
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,245
haven't thought about what
I want to do after that.

133
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,715
Do I want to be famous?
Do I want to be rich?

134
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,883
Is it OK as long as
I'm having fun?

135
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,420
I don't know the
answer yet

136
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,589
In any case I want to
start something, and

137
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,992
in the course of it, 
grasp something.

138
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,027
At this rate, a 
year will pass

139
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,595
before we even realize it.

140
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,497
So let's do this.

141
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,301
Sorry, but I can't get
into that mood today

142
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,271
Sorry. I pass, too

143
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,340
Yuka!

144
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,247
It's not just about the crab..

145
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,751
Those two just don't get
along with each other

146
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,276
Ken!

147
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,150
I asked Ray if I can
practice here once

148
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,551
in a while

149
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,020
Is that right?

150
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,792
People just don't get
along to begin with.

151
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,962
If you talk, you end up fighting
and saying things you shouldn't

152
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:49,374
Maybe we dance to convey what
we can't express in words.

153
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,181
Just believe in it...

154
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,450
Believe in dancing.

155
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,319
You'll find your true friends
through dancing.

156
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,456
Try dancing together.

157
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,134
Let's go, Moe!

158
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,870
Hitomi! What's going on?

159
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,611
Yuka! Junko!

160
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,145
Yuka! Junko!

161
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,283
Just believe in dancing..

162
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,652
All we have to
do is dance

163
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,888
What is she yelling about?

164
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,723
How embarrassing.

165
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,927
I'm not going to give up
until you two agree to it

166
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,129
So hurry and make up
with each other!

167
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,297
See you

168
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,368
What's with her?

169
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,036
She's fired up,
isn't she?

170
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,676
That night

171
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,654
Akira.. What is it?

172
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,489
Where's Hitomi?

173
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,125
She went to return some
dishes to Ume

174
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,195
Is something wrong?

175
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,132
Shota seems to
have a fever.

176
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,510
You're right. You have
a little fever

177
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,745
Did you catch a cold?

178
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,981
That's what you get for
leaving your stomach

179
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,183
exposed when you took a
nap in the afternoon.

180
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,285
Let's go and
call Hitomi

181
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,094
It'll probably go
up some more

182
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,032
The doctor's office
is closed already.

183
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,636
I have some medicine.
I'll go and get it.

184
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,808
I won't drink
your medicine

185
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,913
Why not? Why do
you say that?

186
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,582
Because...

187
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,052
You're Dad's enemy
aren't you?

188
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,723
The opposition from Shota
was unexpected.

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,409
After having too much to
drink at Rose s bar

3
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,678
Momoko spent the night
at the Ippongi home.

4
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,205
What happened?

5
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,410
It's late, so vtfh on't you
spend the rig \< here?

6
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,115
Maybe should

7
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,718
You scared me.

8
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,191
Cheers!

9
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,669
Do you remeffiber what
you said earlier?

10
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,473
What you said at
Rose's j)lace.

11
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,646
I can't remember at all
What did 1 say?

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,185
You said you ran off to
get married, teft Jiome

13
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,421
and threw everything away,
but you don't regret jt

14
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,959
J may have exaggerated
it d little

15
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,328
There s one thing
I regret

16
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,465
Is it about Grandma?

17
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,771
I made her sad until
t ^{Jay shetfied

18
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,909
She was cau Tht between
me and Dad... And

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,546
I wish she could have
seen more of you

20
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,617
But! can't do anything
about it anymore.

21
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,687
You can do something
a ou ii now

22
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,856
Just make up with Grandpa

23
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,559
! think that would make
Grandma happy

24
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,994
It's not that easy.

25
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,729
Why not?

26
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,832
You both just have to be
honest with each other

27
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,871
If I did that, I would wonder
why I made Mom so sad

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,941
for over 20 years

29
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,947
1 think Dad feels
the same way.

30
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:44,256
it's going to take time
to melt the ice ^hat s

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,825
been building up
for 20 years

32
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,668
Hitomi

33
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,239
Look the other way...

34
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,544
I'm going to cry

35
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,675
Get sticky.. Get stickier

That's pretty heavy

54
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,583
Even when she's drunk.
your mom says some

55
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,252
profound things,
doesn't she?

56
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,921
She's more profound
when she's drunk.

57
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,157
She normally doesn't
say things like that

58
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,225
So what are you
going to do?

59
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,595

Trying too Hard to Find Happiness
Episode 60

2
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,127
I'll go over to his place now

3
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,436
But that woman is over there

4
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,606
Then it's perfect

5
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,942
The three of us can talk it over

6
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,348
Hitomi and the others were worried, so they went to

7
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,750
Mr. Katsumata's apartment with Keiko

8
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,320
Right here

9
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,026
Keiko?

10
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,369
Can you go by yourself?

11
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,842
Stay calm

12
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,046
If anything happens, I'll help you

13
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,053
Just go ahead

14
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,923
We'll wait for you here

15
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,495
Someone's coming

16
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,097
Hide!

17
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,916
It was him after all 

18
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,355
She kissed him!

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,960
See you

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,334
Keiko! Go and talk to him.

21
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,203
I'm afraid!

22
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,537
Keiko!

23
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,272
I can't!

24
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,910
Okay! I'll go

25
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,480
Hey! Katsumata!

26
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,085
Give it up

27
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,054
We have all the proof we need

28
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,345
I'll make tea

29
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,413
No... Don't bother

30
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,450
Just tell us what's going on

31
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,419
Sit down

32
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,959
Mr. Katsumata

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,762
Please tell Keiko the truth

34
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,640
Who is that woman?

35
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,581
Until last year, she was my girlfriend

36
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,883
We were together for three years

37
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,219
It was right before I met Keiko.

38
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,154
You mean you got back together again?

39
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,490
Yes

40
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,126
When?

41
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,029
You mean you were together before you

42
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,064
came to Tsukishima with Keiko?

43
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,100
No.. It was right after that

44
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:08,173
She called, and asked if we could go out to eat

45
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,143
Why didn't you turn her down?

46
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,812
You could have told her you had a fiancee!

47
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,581
That's true...I could have

48
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,218
But you couldn't forget her, right?

49
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,355
Yes

50
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:31,296
You felt that way, and you were seeing Keiko?

51
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,999
I thought I could forget about her

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,037
Keiko wasn't seeing you just so you could forget

53
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,474
about your ex-girlfriend!

54
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,814
Keiko dreamed of having a happy family

55
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,486
She wanted to have that happy family with you!

56
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,291
Keiko...

57
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,594
Keiko...

58
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,300
Why are YOU crying?

59
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,549
What were you planning to do?

60
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,791
Were you going to sneak behind my back,

61
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,659
and go on seeing her?

62
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,001
I knew I had to tell you, but..

63
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,737
You're going to choose her.

64
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,388
Mr. Katsumata

65
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,460
You promised me, didn't you?

66
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,731
That you would build a family filled with

67
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,567
warmth together with Keiko

68
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,771
Was that all a lie?

69
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,774
At the time it was true

70
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,077
I was moved by Keiko's strong desire to get

71
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,348
married as soon as possible and have a warm family life

72
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,754
What a strange thing to say

73
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,725
What do you mean, it was true at the time?

74
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:47,632
That was yesterday, but today's different?

75
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,603
That's not how it goes

76
00:07:54,607 --> 00:08:01,079
To Keiko, building a family life IS her life

77
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,155
Family is everything to her

78
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,392
To Keiko, that is life itself

79
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,995
That's who Keiko is.

80
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,398
You mean you didn't even understand that

81
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,969
and you were dating Keiko...?

82
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,306
I'm sorry

83
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,387
When Hitomi told us that she saw you with another

84
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:49,794
woman, Keiko and I didn't believe it.

85
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,432
We trusted you

86
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,804
and you betrayed that feeling.

87
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,876
Keiko put her life on the line, and trusted you

88
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,581
And you betrayed that feeling!

89
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,053
I'm sorry

90
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,791
I'm really sorry

91
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,372
Mr. Katsumata...?

92
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,779
Raise your head

93
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,501
Goodbye.

94
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,842
Thank you, everybody

95
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,416
It was kind of strange, wasn't it?

96
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:55,020
Having the family around when you're breaking up

97
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,122
That's true

98
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,359
It made me reflect a bit

99
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,200
That maybe I was trying too hard to find happiness

100
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,039
And when it started to fall apart, I tried to

101
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,374
pretend that it wasn't happening.

102
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,910
It's the same for me

103
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,747
I have a ways to go.

104
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,785
Shall we go home?

105
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,487
What are you going to do, Mom?

106
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,389
I'll grab a cab and go home

107
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,560
Pull your spirits up, Keiko

108
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,595
Just forget a guy like that.

109
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,764
I will

110
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,866
Good night

111
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,576
What are you going to do, Keiko?

112
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,979
I think I'll walk a little before I go home

113
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,681
and shift my mood

114
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,284
Good idea. Do that

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,590
Dad... I hate to think of what's ahead for me

116
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,228
Will I ever find someone who will accept me?

117
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,233
Of course! Tokyo's a really big place

118
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,136
That's true

119
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,439
Thank you.

120
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,242
Good night.

121
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,847
Keiko...?

122
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,984
You're really adorable

123
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,658
Keiko

124
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,094
I'll see her home

125
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,365
I think she needs me at a time like this

126
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,035
I'll see you home

127
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,003
There's no need

128
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,772
You don't have to be shy

129
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,977
Shall we go?

130
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,685
July, 2007

131
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,621
Summer came to Tsukishima

132
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,737
What's wrong, Katsu?

133
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,772
You've been putting that same shirt on

134
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,340
and taking it off so many times.

135
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,544
I don't have much energy

136
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,812
I wonder if it's the summer doldrums

137
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,313
Maybe I should eat some unagi (boiled eel)

138
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,447
What are you saying?

139
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,049
Summer's only just begun!

140
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,552
A western clothing store is always one

141
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,754
season ahead

142
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,255
It's especially hot today

143
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,525
I'll bring more summer things from upstairs.

144
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,962
I have a feeling summer things will sell today

145
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,964
Keep an eye on the store for me

146
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,669
Yes indeed,

147
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,406
it's really summer today

148
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,311
Did something fall?

149
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,815
Katsu!

150
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,987
Katsu!.. Are you OK?

151
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,527
It's a crisis for the Ippongi family

152
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,731
But Hitomi doesn't know it yet

September, 2007

3
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,634
It's the day when Shota
will see his mother for

4
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,670
the first time in years.

5
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,439
Yes?

6
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,074
Excuse me

7
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,943
Their meeting
has started.

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,748
How was Shota,
Mr. Takayanagi?

9
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,085
He looked up
at his mother

10
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,358

11
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,126
How have you been?

13
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,396
Fine

14
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,303
I brought you a
present, Shota

15
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,639
I wasn't sure what
to get you

16
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:26,211
What do you think it is?
Open it and see

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,290
Video game

18
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,259
Do you have it?

20
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,963
Play with it

21
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,633
Thank you

22
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,972
What's his mother like?

23
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,409
She's about 30

24
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,179
She works at night

25
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,486
Will I be able
to meet her?

26
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,688
Just for a little while
on her way out...

27
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,689
Hitomi

28
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,091

trouble between the

30
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,065
real parent and the foster
parent, the child gets

31
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,135
caught in the middle, and
the child will hurt

32
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,039
That's why we try not to
have the two of you

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,907
come face to face

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,911
There's a reason for this...

35
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,947
Please don't make it
hard on Mr. Wakayama

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,183
I'm sorry

37
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,258
What about your house?
What kind of home is it?

38
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,027
He's lis shirts

39
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,163
A clothing store

40
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,400

Comedy

59
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,603
What do you like to eat?

60
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,472
Natto (fermented
soy beans).

61
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,010
What else?

62
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,613
Meat and potatoes

63
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,630
I'm sorry

64
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,567
I don't know anything
about you, Shota

65
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:42,507
I'm sorry... I couldn't
look after you properly

66
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,951
I won't let you be
lonely anymore.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,936
At first, Shota didn't
say anything, but

68
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,605
eventually, he started
answering his mother's

69
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,874
questions one by one

70
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,879
I guess his mother's feelings
got across to him

71
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,352
Along with spending the
night with her, we want

72
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,490
them to restore their ties as
mother and child gradually

73
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,928
This meeting today is
a big event in Shota's

74
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,499
life, so he might be a
little emotionally

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,503
unstable after this

76
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,509
I hope you'll both help
him to deal with it

77
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,688
Here he is.

78
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,490
Shota

79
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,193
Did you meet
your mom?

80
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,697
Did you talk a lot?

81
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,236
Shall we go home
for today?

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,940
Thank you

83
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,542
Thank you for your
patience

84
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,179
I'll see you out.

85
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,249
Shota

86
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,387
What's wrong, Ms. Saito?
I thought you left.

87
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,456
I'm sorry! I forgot
something.

88
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,158

I'm Saito Mikie

94
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,306
Thank you so much for
taking care of Shota.

95
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,509
I'm sorry I haven't
contacted you.

96
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,312
Who is this?

97
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,415
She's my granddaughter

98
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,917
My name is Hitomi.

99
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,285
I've been helping
Grandpa to..

100
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,821
I see. Thank you
very much!

101
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,825
What did you forget?

102
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,328
My handkerchief...

103
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,964
I must have taken it out
together with the game

104
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,665
Let's go and..

105
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,900
Just a minute...

106
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,803
te king to Shota,
iz thai I have

107
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,805
o to learn...

108
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,974
I'd really appreciate it if
if you could teach me

109
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,444
I'd really appreciate it if
if you could teach me

110
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,384
Ms. Saito... This way.

111
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,787
I see ol. Shota.

112
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,198
I'm sorry...

113
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,733
It wasn't supposed to
turn out like this

114
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,236
Is it okay for
us to leave?

115
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,804
I'm sorry

116
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,944
Hitomi. ?

117
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,113
We're leaving.

118
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,588
I'm sorry! I didn't notice
that she forgot something

119
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,456
It can't be helped..

120
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,158
These things happen.

121
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,827
It didn't bother Katsutaro,
did it?

122
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,330
That's the kind of
person he is

123
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,867
I think tt'sto good t Ing

124
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,236
What was?

125
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,873
The interaction between the
real parent and foster parent

126
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,842
If th l»uld have mo e
in erac ion with each

127
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,312
other, they could develop
a relationship where they

128
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,781
could discuss things together
an't would be ideal for

129
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,582
the c ilia,/wouldn't it?

130
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,152
That's my opinion.

131
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,555
s only jf the real
Yid foster parent

132
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,891

136

For example, if th

in front of the child, or

140
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,612
The child will be caught
in the middle, and he's

141
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,814
going to be terribly hurt

142
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,016
I'm sorry

143
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,253
It's a delicate situation

146

That's the difficult
part of our job

147
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,608
Thank you

148
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,201
Where's Akira?

149
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,903
He went to the library

150
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,705
He did?

151
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,878
Did your mom give
that to you?

152
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,618
What did you talk
to her bout?

153
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,821
Nothing much

154
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,457
You had to talk to her
about something!

155
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,693
What did you talk about?
What is she like?

156
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,002
Give it back!

157
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,869
No!

158
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,540
What are you doing, Yuria?

159
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,175
Yuria took my game!

160
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,278
That's because you were
being mean to me

161
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,081
You're his older sister
Give that back to him

162
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,015
No!

163
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,688
Shota

164
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,060
Yuria... Why did
you do that?

165
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,468
Shota

166
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,841
Shota

167
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,127
Yuria..

168
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,196
Yuria... give it
back to Shota

169
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,031
No! I don't want to

170
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm home

171
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,268
I'm home.

172
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,905
What's wrong?

173
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,843
Yuria took away the game
that Shota s mother

174
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,046
gave himr anti ^tifc won't
give it back to him

175
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,556
Yuria..

176
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,192
Let it go

177
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,193
No!

178
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,763
Let it go!

179
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,531
No!

180
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,380
How's Shota?

181
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,615
He's lying down
and crying.

182
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,920
Yuria!

183
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,023
Why did you do something
like this? You're his

184
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,791
older sister, aren't you?

185
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,894
Because Shota was mean

186
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,730
What do you mean?

187
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,101
He wouldn't tell me
about his mother

188
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,406
And he wouldn't tell me what
he talked to her about.

189
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,149
It's been a long time
since Shota has seen

190
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,422
his mother, and he has
a lot to think about

191
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:24,162
And he's having a hard time
putting it into words

192
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,502
I know you want to hear
what happened, but give

193
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,005
him a little more time

194
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,342
He's not trying
to be mean

195
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,854
The children are
feeling confused.

4
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,384
That was entry number 24.

5
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,919
ROSE MARY

6
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,521
Give them a hand!

7
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,150
Good job! Good job!

8
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,953
It was really good

9
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,727
Yuka!

10
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,863
You were great!

11
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,031
It was really great

12
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,933
Dad said it was
great, too

13
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,469
Thanks for coming

14
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,339
I remembered 
when you were little

15
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,308
you used to watch TV
and dance

16
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,677
We would clap and enjoy
watching you

17
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,279
It was fun

18
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,550
Watching you dance,
I thought how nice 

19
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,218
it would be 
to be a family

20
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,686
like that again

21
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,389
Come and have dinner
with us soon..

22
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,157
I'll bring a bottle
of wine then

23
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,026
I'll see you

24
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,233
Let's go, Dad

25
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,801
Thanks

26
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,908
To all of us dancers,
being able to welcome

27
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,078
this unit back again is
really and truly a

28
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,347
great joy

29
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,917
Four years ago, after a
tragic event, this unit

30
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,086
went from three to two

31
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,323
Today, these two will dance
together for the first

32
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,425
time in four years

33
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,595
Together with Eiji,
the third dancer...

34
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,531
Entry number 28

35
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,233
Chi-pass

36
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,933
It really seemed as though
Eiji was there with them.

37
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,693
Entry number 28.

38
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,295
Chi-pass

39
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,763
Give them a hand!

40
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,313
My brother was there
with you.

41
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,091
My brother was happy
that he could dance

42
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,127
with you two,
wasn't he?

43
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,071
You have now seen all
28 entries dance

44
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,942
Now the judges will go to
a separate room to make

45
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,443
their decision

46
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,780
In the meantime, all of
you can party along

47
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,382
with the DJ

48
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,122


49
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,625


50
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,126


51
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,002
I can't wait to hear
the results

52
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,672
But

53
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,775
You were pretty good.

54
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,350
He praised me!

55
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,519
Did you hear that?

56
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,087
"You were pretty good"

57
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,689
Moe, Moe!

58
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,126
What a surprise

59
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,729
You didn't have to come.
I don't go on stage.

60
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,364
Of course we
had to come

61
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,999
We're here because
you don't go on stage.

62
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,268
All the people who danced
had people to applaud them

63
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,903
but only a parent would
applaud someone who's

64
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,704
not onstage to dance.

65
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,040
My dad and mom

66
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,211
Moe's always indebted
to all of you

67
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,281
Here you go, Manager.

68
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,652
I'm embarrassed.

69
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,787
We'll see you at home

70
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,222
Thank you

71
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,124
Thank you very much.

72
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,727
What good parents!

73
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,829
This is cute!

74
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,631
It's cute

75
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,266
Kazu?

76
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,203
Are you leaving?

77
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,973
We already know we won't
win with that dance.

78
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,075
I'll be back next year.

79
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,149
I'll choreograph a more
cheerful dance for us,

80
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,851
following your example

81
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,725
Thank you

82
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,395
Good work!

83
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,843
Thank you all
for waiting

84
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,513
Here are the results of
the judges decision

85
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,821
This is a tense moment

86
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,057
Only the judges and myself
know what the results are

87
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,460
Let's get started

88
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,697
First with the Judges
Special Award...

89
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,637
The winner of this award
can't go on to the finals.

90
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,641
But in recognition of real
ability and achievement

91
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,410
We'd like to present
this special award

92
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,750
The Judges Special
Award goes to...

93
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,727
Entry number 28
Chi-pass

94
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,037
Please come up


95
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,574
I can imagine this special
judges award brings some emotions

96
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,344
Congratulations, Ken
and Ray!

97
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,084
I can imagine this special
judges award brings some emotions


98
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,320
Please say a few words.

99
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,424
Thank you, everyone.

100
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,530
We're really happy to be back on
stage as Chi-pass again

101
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,932
after all these years..

102
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,736
From now on, let's all 
do our best to 

103
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,004
lift up dancing!

104
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,172
Thank you!

105
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,477
That was great, Suzuki!

106
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,479
Yuzo? Who's Suzuki?

107
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,115
His name is Suzuki Ken

108
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,584
That's Suzuki?

109
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,956
Thank you for waiting.

110
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,358
I'd like to announce the
teams that will 

111
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,828
advance to the nationwide
final competition

112
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,932
Only three teams out of
the 28 entries for this

113
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,701
Tokyo competition will
go on to the nationwide

114
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,269
final contest

115
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,772

With their salaryman
dance.

They will go on to the
nation-wide contest

119
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:54,205
From the judges, here's
your ticket to the finals

Entry number 13 - Bad Dream

122
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,965
Aren't you glad it
wasn't a "bad dream"?

123
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,503
Here's your ticket from 
the judges

124
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,739

Twenty-three!
Marshmallow Stick

00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:15,186
The last ticket
to the finals.

00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,991
Congratulations!

130
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,531
These three teams have
won tickets to the

131
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,933
nation-wide finals

132
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,169
Give them all a
big, big hand!

133
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,774
That's the end of the
Tokyo competition

134
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,776
for the 2008 Dance Beat

135
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,745
Thank you all
for coming

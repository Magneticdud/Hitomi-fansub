You don't have to make it
sound like such a feat

128
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,822
Just because you
sold two shirts

129
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,023
That's enough already

130
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,691

giving it a try

187
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,256
Then let's do it

188
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,460
The level is different
this time

189
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,466
There's a big contest on
a national level that's

190
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,635
held every year for
street dancers

191
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,941
Dance Beat is one of those
nationwide contests

192
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,043
that Hitomi and the
others are aiming for

193
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,812
It's a big event that's
equal to the Koshien

194
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,881
high school baseball
tournament where

195
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,283
only the best of the best
units can win

196
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,319
He p eliminanes will
Bin March to we

197
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,620
ti vb five months

198
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,956
L T«do our best so
we can make it

199
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,524
INh i ut you, Junko?

200
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,727
I think I want to
give it a try

201
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,696
It makes me happy
that we won

202
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:08,967
I'm happy, too that
we won but what

203
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,003
makes me even happier is
that we had fun dancing

204
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,639
together up on the stage

205
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,509
When we danced the Matsuri
Mambo, it was the heated

206
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,346
atmosphere of a festival,
but up on the tage, we

207
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,883
all did our best and
had fun dancing.

208
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,186
Let's aimtotrec

211
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,493
Did you decide?

212
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,363
We just decided

213
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,266
Let's do it

214
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,867
Considering the
circumstances

215
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,335
Thank you!

216
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,237
I'm so happy!

217
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,706
Before you change your
minds, let's seal the

218
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,374
deal by putting our
hands together

219
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,842
Ready

220
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,111
ROSE MARY will come
together as one.

221
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,246
and aim for this
year's Dance Beat

222
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,614
Put our hands
together

223
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,819
Do your best
all of you!

224
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,987
We will!

225
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,557
I'll be routing
for you

226
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,431

It is? I'm glad

232
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,789
I put non-slip rubber on
all of the stairs in

233

Actually it's
about Shota

237
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,877
What about Shota?

238
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,981
We were suddenly contacted
by Shota's real mother

239
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,952
For the past two years
we couldn't reach her

240
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,855
At all, so it'st>eeri
a problem for us...

241
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,493
According to his mother
circumstances have

242
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:20,565
changed quite a bit so she
wants to take Shota back

243
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,140
I pee.. Shota s m ther
wants Sh tafoa

244
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,412
We're home Dad!

245
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,549
I got a hundred
on my math test

246
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,050
That's great!

247
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,819
This is really great
Congratulations

248
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,587

249
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,088
You worked hard,
didn't you?

250
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,824
Go, and put your
b bags down

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,232
Sorry to keep
you waiting

252
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,568
Shota just came home

253
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,736
What do you want
us to do?

254
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,472
We'd like to go over
the details with you

255
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,977
so can you come to
ie cen or scon

256
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,614

1

261
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,849
Hitomi had no idea that
this sudden announcement

262
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,453
would cause problems

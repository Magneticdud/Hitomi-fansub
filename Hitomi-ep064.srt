CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 64

2
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,092
Here

3
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,384
What is it?

4
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,385
For your Grandpa

5
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,470
I forgot to give it him

6
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,846
Give it to him yourself

7
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,389
I don't have time

8
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,183
Here... Take it.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,519
I'll leave the
rest to you

10
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,271
Did Momoko leave?

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,399
What a com lie 1 air.

12
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,367
A towel? It's a towel.

13
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,591
Momoko ended up fighting
with Katsutaro again

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,094
when she came to visit him
in the hospital.

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,102
II

16
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,958
said, the surgery
didn't take that long.

17
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,335
Don't scare me like that.

18
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,172
o o worried that

ing, ant)
an ver here.

20
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,427
You keep saying "moo, moo.'
Are you a cow?

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,682
Go on back to work

22
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,267
You're busy aren't you?

23
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,311
Dad

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,687
What?

25
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,314
Maybe you should take
this chance to lose

26
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,357
some weight.. From this
angle, you look like

27
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,942
a raccoon dog . nament

28
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,361
Mom!

29
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,323
Why that little

30
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,122
You're back

31
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,166
I'm sorry I left in the
middle of the meeting.

32
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,417
How did it go
after I left?

33
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,169
We didn't make any
progress at all 

34
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,879
Everything's the
same as as before

35
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,757
Without you, we can't
make any decisions

36
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,967
%idth branch manager
ke if we really had

37
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,844
any motivation at all.

38
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:41,803
He did? I'm sorry.

39
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,889
He did? I'm sorry.

40
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,184
Shall we continue the
fc ingtSia^ then?

41
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,061
Can you stay overtime?

42
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,021
Tomorrow will be
soon enough...

43
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,191
You can't ask the employees
to work overtime for your

44
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,734
own convenience

45
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,614
u see ; to be busy with
other things, but

46
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,573
I expect you to
do your best

47
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,532
I expect you to
do your best

48
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:03,992
I will.

49
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,411
I'm going back
to Sapporo

50
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,291
Good night.

51
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,801
It's okay with us
Let's do it

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,552
Let's do it.

53
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,847
Let's do it tomorrow
You can all go home

54
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,809
All right.

55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,228
Good night

56
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,468
Hitomi!

57
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,970
Shall I give you a hand?

58
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,597
No. it's okay. I'm sorry
dinner's so late.

59
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,099
Go, and finish
your homework

60
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,353
Good evening!

61
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,689
Mom?

62
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,567
I thought I'd help
you with dinner

63
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,485
I bought croquettes.

64
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,903
Thanks

65
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,281
Were you drinking?

66
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,533
Just a little
I had two beers

67
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,953
It's hot

68
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,333
Do something.

69
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,209
But what?

70
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,670
About your attitude
toward Grandpa.

71
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,340
1 Vnowjtivas my fault
, \itjcoldn t

72
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,635
you have been a little nicer to
him when you were there?

73
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,679
I was going to, but that
old man started calling

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,098
eggin eon

75
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,434
He was just embarrassed

76
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,979
I'd better say "hello"
to Mom first.

77
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,859
Mom.. Dad's in the
hospital. Please

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,862
watch over Hitomi and
the children.

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,156
I'll do my best, too

80
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,201
don't care what
happens to Dad

81
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,378
Where are the
children?

82
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,171
They're upstairs

83
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,548
Get them to help you
prepare dinner

84
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,133
It's okay

85
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,094
They're working on their
summer vacation homework

86
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,221
They can do that
after dinner

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,639
Don't spoil them

88
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,351
I don't remember spoiling you
when you were growing up.

89
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,979
I'm not spoiling them.

90
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,357
I'm going to call them

91
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,527
Don't force them

92
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,322
They can help when they
finish their homework

93
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,663
Good evening.
It's Hitomi's mom.

94
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,833
I'm coming in

95
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,059
Hitomi's mom.

96
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,187
Why are you playing
instead of helping out?

97
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,730
We're not playing..

98
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,858
We were helping Shota
with his project

99
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,776
This runs with
rubberbands

100
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,029
How nice.. But you're already
done with it, aren't you?

101
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,531
More or less.

102
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,575
Then come downstairs
and help out.

103
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,243
While Dad is away, you
have to look after

104
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,829
the house, don't you?
Get your act together

105
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,831
*eV& o*

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,125
urr

107
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,795
I don't-like ^rattitude

108
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,964
Ignore her

109
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,299
Letedlt again

110
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,186
Is there something that has
to be done after this?

111
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,774
I'm going to wash
the dishes.

112
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,319
Shall I do the ironing?

113
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,362
OK thanks.

114
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,031
Is the laundry upstairs?

115
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,783
OK, children... after we're
finished lied e ling, we're going

116
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,160
to do the ironing.

117
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,664
Hurry, and eat.

118
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,631
It's stiil wrinkled
over there.

119
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,966
You have to stretch
this out like this

120
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,551
Aunty. Aunty

121
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,802
Put some strength in
your shoulder Tj^fid..

122
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,929
Aunty!

123
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,263
Are you talking
to me?

124
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,390
Shota's still
learning...

125
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,518
That's why I'm having
him do this.

126
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,810
it's going to burn

127
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,854
Dad said he can just
do it gradually

128
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,816
Dad does it
his way

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,902
I ad t my way

130
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,696
I don't understand
what you're saying.

131
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,241
Just do it properly!

132
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,618
Stretch it out first ...

133
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,163
Not like that

134
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,540
Aunty!

135
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,921
Hitomi!

136
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,507
Shota's going to cry

137
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,677
Can't you do something
about her?

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm not trying to
pick on them.

139
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,191
Sin they're summer
vacation Jm n

140
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,528
trying to make sure they
don't etJa y.

141
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,488
I'm only doing it for
their own

142
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:39,202
] jun e s an , but It's
e icSte problem...

143
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,872
It's difficult until you
can win their trust.

144
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,791
Trust?

145
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,505
I remember when I first
came to live here...

146
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,924
If I said one thing even
a little harsh, they

147
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,884
wouldn el gainst me

148
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,223
On o .at, you and
Grandpa don't get along

149
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,226
What does that have
to do with it?

150
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,229
Thos i s eally

00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,575
All right

154
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,747
I'm leaving. You can tell
them Aunty's leaving.

155
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,499
un y wait a minute.

156
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,878
I agree with you.

157
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,591
What did I expect? They've
already seen the way

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:39,596
I fight with Dad... I'll be more
careful from now on.

159
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,016
If I want to be of help
to you, I'll have to

160
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,060
get along with
those kids.

161
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,689
Maybe I'll stop somewhere
and have a drink before

162
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,982
I go home

163
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,692
See you.

164
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,320
Thanks for everything.

165
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,113
Good night.

166
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,411
Hitomi!

167
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,205
Come with me

168
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,467
It's not easy
for me.

169
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,972
Things aren't going well
at work, and the branch

170
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,142
manager is always
on my case

171
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,937
It must be rough

172
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,647
It sure is!

173
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,566
It's not easy trying to
sel cosmetics that we

174
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,152
sold only in Hokkaido,
out here in Tokyo

175
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,821
Things like that take
time, don't they?

176
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,033
To to ifTJff, I skipped out
in the middle of an

177
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,994
important meeting to solve
that problem, to go to

178
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,830
the hospital!

179
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,208
And what does that old man
He asked me if I

180
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,710
was a cow

181
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,962
What's this about a cow?

182
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,423
Mom kept saying, moo.
irf&t " So Grandpa

183
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,049
asked her if she
was a cow

184
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,509
get ft!

185
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,553
It's not funny!

186
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,596
I'm sorry

187
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,851
He made it sound like he
didn't want me to come

188
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,603
anymore, and when I got
back to the office,

189
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,356
the branch manager got
on my case again

190
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,525
And when I went to the
house, the children

191
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,777
didn't like me either

192
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,238
It makes me so sad

193
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,824
to drink tonight

194
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,493
You already had
enough, Mom!

195
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Stop

196
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,757
Why are you such a
good little girl?

197
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,884
What do you mean
by that?

198
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,887
You take care of the
house, look after

199
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,848
the children, and your
grandpa, too

200
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,477
What about your dancing?

201
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,104
Isn't that why you
came to Tokyo?

202
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,148
I'm dancing!

203
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,274
I'm going to school

204
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,525
School is chtstfl

205
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,402
What about the future?

206
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,613
What's your goal?

207
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,074
e.1.4

208
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,577
Decide on your goal

209
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,747
If you don't have a goal, you
can't go full speed ahead.

210
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,128
Just do what you
want to do

211
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,883
Just throw everything
else away

212
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:28,264
I threw everything away when
I ran off with your dad

213
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,937
Thanks to that, I'm still having
a big fight with Dad

214
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,117
I told you... you had
too much to drink

215
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,792
But... I don't have
any regrets.

216
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,213
I did what I wanted to do

217
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,132
And I had you

218
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,179
Hitomi..

219
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,099
It's your life

220
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,896
Decide what you want to do
with your dancing

221
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,320
She's hopeless

222
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,155
Trying to pick a fight
with her daughter

223
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,324
Let her stay at your place

224
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,326
She can't go home
in that condition

225
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,212
Momoko's words pierced
Hitomi's heart.

226
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:46,050
She still hasn't found what
she a e If fn dancing

227
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,015
Jqw she had another
new Yk for summer

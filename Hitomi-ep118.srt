66
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,369
Is it for the pay?

67
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,872
Or sjt burden
of responsibility

68
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:15,347
It's not just that...

69
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:21,053
It's being told,
thank you

70
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,723
Thank you?

71
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:32,164
If one of my workers has a
problem, and I come up

72
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,500
With a good idea, they'll
thank me for it

73
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,537
If I increase sales, the
people at the top will

74
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,639
say "Thank you" too.

75
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:47,145
And sometimes the customers who
use our cosmetics will say,

76
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,047

Sure

114
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,475


115
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,446
We got it cleaned
up quickly

116
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,415
It's so different
when you're here

117
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,556

00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,792

Will you?

120
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,197
Really?

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,331
Of course

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,966
OK

123
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,402
Ready?

124
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,307
So stiff!

125
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,942
Isnt' it?

126
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,710
It's built up over
the years

127
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,914
Years of stiffness.

128
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,116
It's not easy
working, is it?

129
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,085
No matter what kind
of work you do...

130
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,522
Was Momoko working hard?

131
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,458
She was working
super hard

132
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,994
That hard, huh7

133
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,765

138
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:54,025
Also... She t larner that
you can't just like it

139
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,597
You need people to tell
you, Thank you

140
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,866
That's what gives you
something in common

141
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,702
with the rest of
the world.

142
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,039
I feel like she was telling me
that I've enjoyed my

143
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,075
life up until now, so
I need to find what

144
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,310
I want to do now.

145
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,383
Aren't you glad
you learned something?

146
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,719
I'm glad.

147
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,223
Do you like what you do

148
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,326
i o now

149
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,228
You didn't before?

150
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,099
I used to think it
was too plain

151
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,702
When us o eemydad
watching the store and

152
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,239
holding clothes up for
the customers to see

153
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,644
I thought it seemed
really boring

154
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,113
That's how it is with
young people, isn't it?

155
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,648
Maybe

156
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,084
But when I go to the
store an tar e

157
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:58,089
working in t Jtho ign it
was pretty totere in

158
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,361
The kind of clothes you
sell changes with the

159
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,230
seasons, doesn't it?

160
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,799
In the spring, you sell
school clothes

161
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,201
In the summer, you sell
Aloha shirts

162
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,538
I began to think of it as
a business that tun s

163
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,575
the seasons o his o n

164
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,713
Then it escalated from
there, and I began to

165
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,149
feel as though a n
charge fw t vet e

166
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,152
til this neighborhood
in th$rjc«oses.

167
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,327
That's what it jriean o rj(

168
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,365
There aren't many people
who find a job they

169
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,368
like from the beginning
so I don't see what's

170
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,438
wrong with gradually le nm
to like what you do.

171
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,940
That may be true

172
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,677
You're good,
aren't you?

173
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,778
Am I?

174
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,516
Press down hard
around the neck

175
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,753
That's it. !

176
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,590
The dried bonito in
s Iciji makes a

177
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,960
different soup base..

178
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,730
Your miso soup will
change starting today.

179
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,032
Thank you for the meal.

180
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,201
It's OK, 
I'll get it

181
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,303
Thank you

182
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,407
Hey, Ken! Did you
sell anything?

183
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,742
A little over
10,000 yen

184

197
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,836
Hello.

198
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,973
Mayuge Neko again?

199
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,810
Mr Ishn called and asked
if we'd do it again this

200
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,378
coming Saturday

201
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,180
Sure, I'll do it.

202
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,082
It's been a while
since I danced.

203
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,218
I wonder what to do about
the other members..

204
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,888
That's right..

205
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,529
I know someone.

206
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,265
Mayuge Neko?

207
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,167
Yes

208
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,601
Me?

209
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,569


210
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,839
It's this dance... the one
Yuria and Akira were

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,307
teaching you at the
flower-viewing party

212
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,475
4 knowlh lit

213
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,110
It's really popular
with children..

214
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,945
We'll have to make you up
a little bit..

215
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,880
Just with some whiskers
like a cat...

216
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,384
I've never done anything
like that before.

217
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,486
You won't do it?

218
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,521
I'll do it

219
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,790
Thank you!

220
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,228
Actually...

221
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,530
We need one more person...

222
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,599
We need a group of
four to dance.

223
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,901
One more person?

224
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,113
This is more fun
than I thought.

225
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,583
Do you like it?

226
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,720
I feel like I can dance
a little differently

227
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,556
Girls are lucky

228
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,059
They look good in
stuff like this.

229
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,065
How's this.. ?

230
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,238
Perfect, Ken!

231
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,206
They'll love it!

232
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,875
I hope so

233
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,409
Wait a minute

234
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,346
Maybe it should be a
little more colorful

235
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,847
Colorful?

236
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,583
Where?

237
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,685
Maybe at the base
of the whiskers.

238
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,487
Let's try that

239
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,923
Looks like it'll 
be an awesome

240
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,524
performance of
Mayuge Neko

Tryingg too Hard to Find Happiness'
Episode 59

2
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,493
They're sitting in front of Mr. Katsumata's

3
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,629
apartment, but there are no lights on

4
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,567
These two have decided to wait until Mr. Katsumata

5
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,202
comes home

6
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,573
What are you going to do when he comes home?

7
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,707
Are you going to grill him?

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,876
I'll start by grilling him.

9
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,479
Hitomi saw you in Atami. What's going on?

10
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,748
But he might pretend that he's innocent

11
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,951
We'll deal with that when the time comes

12
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,654
But I didn't expect this

13
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,022
Expect what?

14
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,058
For you to go this far.

15
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,094
I thought you'd say, "Don't butt into a

16
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,263
stranger's love affair"

17
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,801
Keiko's not a stranger

18
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,639
After I left home, she lived in my room for 10 years.

19
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,376
I can't just let it go

20
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,048
He came home

21
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,429
Is she the one?

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,531
That's her

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,634
So she's the Atami woman.

24
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,186
What are we going to do?

25
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,221
Should we barge in?

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,291
I didn't expect him to be with the woman

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,128
If Keiko finds out about this, the shock will be

28
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,930
too much for her

29
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,699
Let's at least tell Dad

30
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,035
You're going to Tsukishima?!

31
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,770
It's a matter of great importance to Keiko

32
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,071
We can't just let it go!

33
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,180
While they headed to Tsukishima...

34
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,320
Good evening!

35
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,623
Keiko! it's unusual for you to be here at this hour

36
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,091
I'm on my way home from the hospital.

37
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,226
Where's Hitomi?

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,927
Hitomi went over to Momoko's place

39
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,529
To help her move in, and they

40
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,331
were going to have dinner after that

41
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,500
Did you come to talk to Hitomi?

42
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,868
Not really.

43
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,205
I want to show you something.

44
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:01,840
What is it?

45
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:02,174
What is it?

46
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,611
Is it a handkerchief?

47
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,947
When one of my patients heard I'm getting married,

48
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,882
she embroidered this for me: "Happy Wedding"

49
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:18,824
Even the patients love you, don't they?

50
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,095
That's right... I have something to

51
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,364
show you, too. It's good!

52
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,499
What is it?

53
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,872
It's this "For big sister Keiko"

54
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,842
What is that?

55
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,211
This is also a "happy wedding" card.

56
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:39,911
This is also a "happy wedding" card.

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,347
Yuria and Shota made it for you

58
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,116
The children are also happy that you're getting married.

59
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:44,683
The children are also happy that you're getting married.

60
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,487
Aren't you going on a date today?

61
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,357
He's so busy we hardly get to see each other

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,695
I see...But I'm so glad that everyone's so happy

63
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,497
about your marriage.

64
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,233
I heard the teachers at the orphanage were really

65
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,768
happy for you too.

66
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,202
When I went to the staff room, they gave me a

67
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,071
big round of applause

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,073
Mr. Kubota even cried.

69
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,642
Is that right?

70
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,645
You made your best effort.

71
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,580
You worked hard, and became a nurse.

72
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,182
You worked hard at your job, so

73
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,618
you were able to make this connection.

74
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,753
You need to treasure the fate that brought you

75
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,221
two together.

76
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,190
I will. No matter what.

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,161
I'm home!

78
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,095
Hitomi

79
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,630
Keiko!

80
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,632
Momoko's with you?

81
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,100
This is perfect

82
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,535
I didn't say you could come in!

83
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,570
This is no time for us to be fighting

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,038
What is it?

85
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,040
Will the two of you sit down?

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,378
What is it?

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,980
I heard from Hitomi.

88
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,350
That she saw Mr. Katsumata in Atami.

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,386
Hitomi! You mean you even told Momoko?

90
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,622
That's because neither of you would believe me.

91
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:03,195
So I thought we should see if it was true

92
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,197
Since the two you didn't want to do it, I thought

93
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,498
we should do it

94
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,166
Did you talk to Mr. Katsumata?

95
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,569
I was going to, but when we went to his apartment,

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,304
he wasn't home yet.

97
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,142
While we were waiting, he came back with a woman.

98
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,113
The same woman that Hitomi saw in Atami

99
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,753
So I came here to tell you that.

100
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,891
It's none of your business.

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,628
How can you say that?

102
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,031
We were only thinking of you.

103
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,436
Why do you want to throw a wet blanket on my happiness?

104
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,938
That's not what we're doing.

105
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,841
Since we know, we can't just ignore it

106
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,977
Someone like you wouldn't understand

107
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,880
Even having a mother and father

108
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,550
who are there and feeding you, 

109
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,352
you left home for your own selfish reasons

110
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,920
Keiko!

111
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,722
You, too, Dad...

112
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,024
The only reason you raised me is because she

113
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,193
left home, and you were lonely...

114
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,831
You only took me in so I could take her place, didn't you?

115
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,166
You're wrong about that, Keiko

116
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,002
I thought that ever since I was little!

117
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,005
Ever since I heard that you had a daughter

118
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,341
named Momoko who left home after you had a big fight

119
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:29,214
and probably wouldn't come back - that's what I thought.

120
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,857
You're badly mistaken.

121
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,893
Dad really hates me

122
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,831
He wouldn't be lonely even if he couldn't see me anymore

123
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,966
If he was lonely, it's because he couldn't

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,334
see Hitomi anymore

125
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,802
Mom!

126
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,573
All he ever did was yell at me, but he couldn't

127
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,908
spend enough time with you.

128
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,044
When I brought you here for the first time,

129
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,314
he carried you with him and really took care of you.

130
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,050
That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

131
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,618
Sure it does.

132
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,788
You raised Keiko with the same feeling you felt when

133
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,792
you were holding Hitomi didn't you?

134
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,596
And now Keiko is the one with a crisis

135
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,637
What business is it of yours anyway?

136
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,507
You're making a big thing out of something that

137
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,609
wouldn't have been a problem if she didn't

138
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,978
know about it, if you hadn't told her!

139
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,213
How can you say that?

140
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:40,819
What's all this this? We can hear you from outside.

141
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,088
Are you fighting again?

142
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,857
Keiko..?

143
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,594
It's something very important to Keiko.

144
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,829
Momoko!

145
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,665
When Hitomi went to a hotel in Atami for a part-time

146
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,368
job, she saw Mr. Katsumata dressed in a cotton kimono

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,471
walking arm-in-arm with some other woman.

148
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,710
Is that true, Hitomi?

149
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,648
She's mistaken.

150
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,384
No, I'm not!

151
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,352
Do something, Katsu.

152
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,054
Go over to that Katsumata's place and..

153
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,656
Hitomi and already went

154
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,090
And what happened?

155
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,059
He came home, arm-in-arm with that woman Hitomi

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,561
saw in Atami.

157
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,631
After we saw that, we came here to tell you about it

158
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,667
You mean that Katsumata's at his place 

159
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,168
with another woman?

160
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,903
That's right.

161
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,472
I'm going to beat him up!

162
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,407
Where are you going?

163
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,309
To Katsumata's place, of course!

164
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,010
Do you know where he lives?

165
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,378
Well, no...

166
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,247
Idiot!

167
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:50,789
In any case, don't stick your nose in it.

168
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,327
I'm going to marry Mr. Katsumata

169
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,762
Is that OK?

170
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,798
He's betraying you!

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,734
It's OK.

172
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,003
Even if it's true

173
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,938
Why?

174
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,908
You won't understand!

175
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,511
You don't know how much I wanted to be married,

176
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,414
and build a warm family life.

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,250
Keiko

178
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,887
So you have no right to butt into my life!

179
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,758
Keiko

180
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,830
I do know how much you want a warm family

181
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,834
I saw how happy the teachers at the orphanage

182
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,503
were for you.

183
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,008
Even more than me

184
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,678
But..

185
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,316
How do you expect to build a happy family with

186
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,019
someone who betrays you like that?

187
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,795
You have to confront him and confirm

188
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,499
Don't be afraid to see how he feels about you

189
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,440
Katsu

190
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,545
What are you doing down here?

191
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,048
What's wrong?

192
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,251
Are you crying, Keiko?

193
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,088
It's okay... This is grown-up talk.

194
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,894
Keiko's fine, don't worry

195
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,529
Head back upstairs

196
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm sorry we made so much noise

197
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,618
What are you going to do, Keiko?

198
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,362
I'll go over to his place now.

199
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,505
But that woman's there

200
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,941
Then it's perfect...

201
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,844
The three of us can talk it over

202
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,851
Momoko

203
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,188
Thank you for worrying about me

204
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,327
I'm sorry I said such rude things to you.

205
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,001
And Dad...

206
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,537
I'm sorry about what I said earlier

207
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,172
What was that?

208
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,575
Saying that I was just a replacement for Momoko.

209
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,784
That's how I felt when I was little

210
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:11,055
But when I was in middle school, I realized that

211
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:16,060
you were really looking out for me

212
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,843
I'm going now

213
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,157
Shall we go with her? I'm worried.

214
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,693
You're right.

215
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,395
Are you both going?

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,363
I'm going, too. Dad, take this.

217
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,135
Then I'm going too.

218
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,537
What am I supposed to do?

219
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,139
The iron is on.

220
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,507
Do you want me to turn it off?

221
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,942
No... finish the ironing

222
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,276
That's Akira's shirt.

223
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,946
Hey Katsu! Wait a minute!

224
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,524
Right here.

225
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,833
Keiko

226
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,736
I'm afraid..

227
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,742
What am I going to do if it's true?

228
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,145
I'm afraid!

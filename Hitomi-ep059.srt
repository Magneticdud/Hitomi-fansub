00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,493
They're sitting in front of
Mr. Katsumatas

3
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,629
apartment, but there are
no lights on

4
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,567
These two have decided to
wait until Mr. Katsumata

5
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,202
comes home

6
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,573
What are you going to do
when he comes hom ?

7
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,707
you going
to grill him?

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,876
I'll start by grilling him.

9
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,479
Hitomi saw you n Atami
What's going on?

10
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,748
But he might pretend
that he's innocent

11
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,951
Well deal with that
when the time comes

12
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,654
But I didn't expect this

13
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,022
Expect what?

14
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,058
F T^pu to go this far.

15
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,094
I thought you'd say, "Don!!
utt into arranger's

16
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,263
love affair"

17
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,801
Ketkos not a stranger

18
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,639
Alter I left ho %hf lived
in my room for 10 years.

19
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,376
leant jusVtltjgb

20
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,048
He came home

21
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,429
Is she the one?

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,531
That's her

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,634
So she's the
Atami woman.

24
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,186
What are we going to do?

25
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,221
"Should we barge in?

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,291
I didn't expect i fm to
be with the woman

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,128
If Keiko finds tout about
this, the shock will be

28
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,930
too rfiuch for her

29
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,699

00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,770

importance to Keiko

32
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,071

You, too, Dad...

Dad really hates me

122
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,831
He wouldnTbe lonely even if
he couldn't see me anymore

123
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,966
if he was Ion 1y, then
it's because he couldn't

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,334
see Hitomi anymore

125
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,802

CHAPTER 12
I Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 71

2
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,472
I'll show you how to 
get there, Eriko

3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,413
I'll eat it all

4
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,918
The lunch party
at Ume's house had

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,653
turned into a disaster

6
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,465
You press down, and
pull it off with the

7
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,366
spatula, and eat it.

8
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,970
I've never had
this before

9
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,439
Hasn't your husband
ever brought you to eat it?

10
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,510
If we come this far we always
end up going Ginza

11
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,347
I want to eat
something else

12
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,683
Why don't you
just try it?

13
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,751
Your dad and grandma
really love this

14
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,054
What do you want to eat?

15
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,188
Hamburger!

16
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,090
Do you have
hamburger?

17
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,227
No, we don't. This is
a monja restaurant.

18
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,229
Spaghetti!

19
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,030
We don't have spaghetti
here

20
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,265
Tuna casserole.

21
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,800
We don't have
that either

22
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,368
That's because this is
a monja restaurant

23
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,903
All we have is monja

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,738
That there is monja!

25
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,409
Maybe there's nothing
here you can eat...

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,379
Icecream!

27
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,182
Icecream?
That's good!

28
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,086
Is it OK? Eating that when
he didn't eat a meal?

29
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,455
It's OK, as long as
it's what he wants

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,092
OK, Makoto, ice cream
please

31
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,728
One icecream, Hiroshi

32
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,864
Here you go.

33
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,868
Not this kind, don't you
have real icecream in a cup?

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,471
No, we don't

35
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:53,872
I guess it'll do then.

36
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,840
I guess it'll do then.

37
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,409
Why don't you try it, Takeshi

38
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,443
I'll try it.

39
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,618
It tastes lousy

40
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,987
I thought so.

41
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,889
Can you throw
this away?

42
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,606
Are you sure
about this?

43
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,678
You're trying to
please your wife

44
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,479
Your wife is trying
to please your son.

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,884
If I lived there

46
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,888
I'd have to try to 
please someone

47
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,490
I don't like that

48
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,759
Then do you plan to stay
in this house forever?

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,329
It's hot in the summer
and cold in the winter

50
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,964
It's bad for your health!

51
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,566
It's the house you were
were raised in

52
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,903
I didn't like it.

53
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,638
It was too small and uncomfortable

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,607
My house is big!

55
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,609
Everyone has their own room.

56
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,544
I read the books I
like in my room,

57
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,446
my wife watches the 
movies she likes in hers

58
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,715
and my son can play
his games in his room.

59
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,883
No one will get
in your way

60
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,052
You can do whatever
you want

61
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,991
Your family doesn't confront
each other, do they?

62
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,593
What do you mean?

63
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,997
Takeshi lied earlier,
didn't he?

64
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,233
He said Shota broke
the planter...

65
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,603
And you just pretended
like you didn't know

66
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,438
If I said something
my wife would have

67
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,140
started nagging me.

68
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,309
So you're running away

69
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,745
You should confront
each other

70
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,381
You live in a big house
with your own rooms,

71
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,116
so it got to the point
where you don't

72
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,651
confront each other
anymore

73
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,185
You're sassy,
aren't you?

74
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,288
That's right, I am!

75
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,123
After all, I'm Momoko's
daughter.

76
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,368
Tetsuo

77
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,838
I'm not going to
do this anymore

78
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm against your
living together

79
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,875
Why change your mind
all of a sudden?

80
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,476
Because I'd feel sorry
for Ume if she had to

81
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,211
live with that wife
of yours

82
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,479
What don't you
like about her?

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,048
Everything!

84
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,916
She spoils your son

85
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,052
She doesn't care about
other people's feelings

86
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,288
We went to Makoto's place,
but your son didn't

87
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,590
even eat "monja' there

88
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,161
He finally chose ice cream,
but he just took one

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,496
bite and left the rest

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,699
He said it tastes bad
compared to the kind

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,600
he eats at home

92
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,237
Your wife permits
him to do that, you know.

93
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,574
She told Makoto to throw
icecream away

94
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,877
What about her is
a "good wife"?

95
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,113
Is it because she's the
daughter of a director?

96
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,382
Because he paid for your house?

97
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,318
Anyway, I'm completely
opposed to your living

98
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,586
together with Ume.

99
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,823
Wait a minute, Momoko

100
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,193
Don't say things
like that.

101
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,062
His mother has to come 
and live with us.

102
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,433
Then let me ask you this...

103
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,670
Why do you want to
live with Ume?

104
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,805
Because it looks bad

105
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,810
After all, it's just
the two, mother and son.

106
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,747
His mother lives in
a cramped place like this
 
107
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:26,785
while we're a big house.
it makes us look bad.

108
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,855
That's what my
father said, too

109
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,991
He said it looks like we're
treating her coldly

110
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,431
Is that it, Tetsuo?

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,067
Is it just for
appearances?

112
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,969
I'm just thinking about
my mom's happiness.

113
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,437
If you live together
in this kind of form,

114
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,272
how can you expect Ume
to be happy?

115
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,373
But I have a sense
of responsibiity.

116
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:48,774
It's just for your tedious
sense of responsibility

117
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,509
and society's opinion

118
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,779
that you want Ume
to live with you?

119
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,516
Are you sure you should
be saying that?

120
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,350
What about the
shopping mall?

121
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:58,917
What about it?

122
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,786
I don't care anymore!

123
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,123
All right, I won't listen to
what you have to say.

124
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:05,991
Dear! Let's go home!

125
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,959


126
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,200
Tetsuo!

127
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,503
What is it, Mom?

128
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,107
I'm going to stay here

129
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,677
I'm going to stay here
in the tenement.

130
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,449
Everyone here is
more like my real family

131
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,488
Sorry to bother you

132
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,796
Dear, hurry up!

133
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,011
I'm thirsty

134
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,113
Ume, I'll make
some tea

135
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,946
Like her real family?

136
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,450
That's sad, isn't it.

137
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:46,224
I'm happy that Ume would
say that, but

138
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:54,032
the reality is that Ume and
her son can't agree to anything.

139
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,106
You should've
seen Mom.

140
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,275
She was really something.

141
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,644
What are you saying?

142
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,211
She couldn't have been.

143
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,080
She said, "Is it just for
appearances, and your

144
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,016
sense of responsibility
that you want to live

145
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,852
with your mother?"

146
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,421
Momoko said that!?

147
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,358
There was talk about Tetsuo's
company letting Mom's

148
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,296
cosmetics company lease
space in their new

149
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,166
shopping mall, but she told him
she didn't care about that

150
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,302
Momoko said that?

151
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:39,811
Never mind! Just make
me some tea

152
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,448
Tea?

153
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,383
Please make me some tea

154
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,996
Momoko

155
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,600
Are you OK?

156
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,735
It's nothing

157
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,218
It's hot! 
What are you having?

158
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,654
Somen noodles.

159
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,356
Somen

160
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,890
Somen

161
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,059
You don't have much
energy, do you?

162
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,494
It's too hot

163
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,235
**e r o rtnindofa!!! n a
thoughts, "Tid you in

164
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,437
fire, fire is cool."**

165
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,689
The deadline was fast
approaching to get

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,259
the others to participate in 
the summer dance contest.

167
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,930
Shall we enter this?

168
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,966
The summer dance contest

169
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,934
Let's form a unit

170
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,336
I'll be the manager.

171
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,437
I don't want to!

172
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,139
Not with this
selfish girl!

173
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,840
I won't do it either!

174
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,322
It's better if you 
confront each other!

175
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,376
Hitomi?

176
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,778
Moe.

177
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,580
What do you mean, confront?

178
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,252
I feel like...

179
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,421
I still have my summer
vacation homework

180
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,390
It hasn't been done

181
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,328
I have to try again to
convince Yuka and Junko

182
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,398
but don't know
what to say

183
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,538
Wait here..

184
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,274
Where are you going?

185
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,376
I'm going to get them
and bring them here.

186
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,011
What, Moe!

187
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,962
Just come with me...

188
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,131
Come on

189
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,832
Hitomi... I brought them.

190
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,641
Sit down... Come on,
and sit down

191
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,884
Please listen to me!

192
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,417
What?

193
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,886
What's wrong?

194
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,524
Before it's too late,
I wanted to talk to

195
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,225
both of you.

196
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:14,492

197
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:14,959

198
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,063
You all came to the festival
the other day, right?

199
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,432
When we danced at Rose's
place to Mari's singing

200
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,201
the Festival Mambo song

201
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,538
What did you think
at the time?

202
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,007
n

203
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,111
That dancing was fun,
after all

204
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,348
I had fun, too. I thought

205
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,387
I really, really want to
dance with you all again!

206
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,291
So let's not let stubborn
pride get in the way,

207
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,226
and let's all dance
together again.

208
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,195
We still have time

209
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,031


210
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,434
I want to do this.

211
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,069
I want to struggle

212
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,371
and grab onto something.

213
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,976
Maybe that's going
a little overboard, but

214
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,679
The prize is $5000

215
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,218
Let's all split
this among us!

216
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:17,856
I give up!

217
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,690
I give up!

218
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,997
Shall we do it?

219
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,765
Really?

220
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,567
You did it, Hitomi!

221
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,605
Let's make a toast

222
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,411
Cheers!

223
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,784
You can have mine, too.

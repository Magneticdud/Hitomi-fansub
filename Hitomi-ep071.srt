68
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,309
So you're running away

69
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,745
You should confront
each other

70
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,381
You live in a ig house
with your own rooms,

71
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,116
so it got to the point
where you donl

72

anymore

73
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,185

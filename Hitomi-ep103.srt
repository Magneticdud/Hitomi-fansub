00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,592
What are you
here for?

6
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,429
We're going to enter the
Tokyo preliminaries...

7
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,015
Why come all the way
to Tokyo for that?

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,600
You can enter the
Osaka preliminaries.

9
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,603
It's no fun unless my
enemies are right

10
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:49,316
there in front of me,
you and Ken.

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,613
Don't run away, and show
what you can do

12
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,710
RAY... What's
this all about?

13
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,297
It's nothing.

14
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,140


15
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,141
Are you okay?

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,475
I'm okay

17
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,144
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

18
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,646
But rumors sure
spread fast

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,315
They've ...already
heard about last

20
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,526
Do you know something?

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,906
What did they

22
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,200
What rumor do you mean?

23
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,662
It's nothing

24
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,498
There's a rumor

25
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,047
1GMVI0BD... What is it?

26
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,052
The information hasn't
been confirmed,

27
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,014
so it would be bad
if rumors spread.

28
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,891
Don't worry...
We won't tell

29
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,144
If you don't tell us,

31

Don't do that!

32
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,733
Then just tell us
a little

33
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,984
Just a little bit...

The rumor is that Ken and
Ray are going to dance at

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,127
the next Dance Beat
Tokyo preliminaries

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,630
And they're going to
dance as CHEAPASS.

42
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,051
Ken and Ray dancing
as CHEAPASS?

43
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,723
CHEAPASS is the legendary
dance unit that consisted

44
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,601
of Ken, Ray, and Eiji

45
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,149
Although they broke up
after Eiji died in a

46
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,527
motorcycle accident four
years ago, they are still

47
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:02,699
what dancers aspire
to become

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,496
That's awesome!
Is it true?

49
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,414

She didn't deny it, but
she didn't confirm it either

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:33,230
So I think Eiji's sister
found out about it

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,110
But isn't the deadline past for
the Tokyo preliminaries?

58
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,528

about it because it's
still uncertain yet

65

Do you understand?

00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,231
That would be so awesome...
The return of CHEAPASS.

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,671

If you get too nervous,
then write the character

for "people" in the palm of
your hand, and drink it

83
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,888
You'll be fine. You studied
really hard for this

84
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,308

postcard with you?

We're busy

00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,325
We need to bring down the
fever 

91
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,202
I wanted to make

chance of him

You're so unreliable
at work, too

127

When I'm not at work, you're
the acting president.

128
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,870
So take control of the
business properly

129
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,163

My fever went up again

133
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,587
It's hot

134
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,005
That's because you're
getting wound up

135
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,798
You're the one who
got me wound up

136
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,341
You're the one who
got me wound up

137
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,390
Yuzo's the acting
president from today?

138
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,893
Until Yujiro gets
over his cold.

139
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,021
It might be just
a little test

140
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,524
for Yujiro

141
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,317
A test?

142
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,362
Once in a while lie, when he
eats here, he says it's

143
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,615
about time he left
the business in Yuzo's

144
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,200
hands. ^o hfe c Yi
take it easy

Wanting to take it as
i lit just be ^a figure

147
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,666
of speech. but he must
want Yuzo to become

148
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,918
a full-fledged businessman too.

149
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,255
o he can survive
here in Tsukiji

150
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,844
Don't complain about every
single thing that I do

151
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,389
It's because you're taking
impossible orders like this

152
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,182
Who's going to deliver
all this anyway?

153
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,143
On top of that, it's
all small orders

154
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,188
I took the orders
on the phone

155
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,815
Since I'm the acting
president now.

156
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,234
At least you could
stagger the delivery times.

157
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,820
All of them are for delivery
by 2 o'clock

158
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,613
Just get a bike delivery
service to do it

159
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,865
You'll lose more
money than you make

160
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,701
All right! I'll just help
with the delivery!

161
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,244
That will satisfy
you, won't it?

162
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,372
I'll have a miso mackerel
medium bowl

163
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,915
Are yoy going to eat?

164
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,000
Of course I am!

165
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,251
I need to keep up my
strength if I'm going

166
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,586
to help with the
deliveries

167
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,088
Hurry and pile
everything up

168
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,256
Get back to work

169
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm doing the
best I can.

170
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,437
Aren't you just spinning
your wheels? From what

171
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,771
little I heard.

172
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,524
They don't take me
seriously at all

173
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,942
They thi Kldorif
know my job.

174
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,611
Because it's th r t

175
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,988
Will you come with me to
Mako's place tonight?

176
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,781

I'm glad.

195
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,409
And here's something
I want to ask you...

196
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,203
About Dance Beat?

197
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,918
If you have time later,
I'd like to talk to you

198
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,547
I have something to do
this afternoon..

199
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,676

00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,641


203
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,185
I haven't had a lot
of monja

204
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,770
Do you know of
a good place?

205
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,356
I do. It's where
I always go

206
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,608
I can be there about
8PM if that's

207
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,110
OK with you

208
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,154
Sure! Sure it's OK.
It's fine with me

209
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,949
I'll meet you at
the station then

210
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,534
Thanks

211
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,537
Can I borrow this?

212
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,539
Go right ahead
,, Hi"

213
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,375

00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,378
There's a convenience
store lo "/< so

215
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,838

216
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,673

00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,680
The pickled vegetables
• III

218
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,307
I'm glad you did well
on your exam, Akira

219
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,602
I think I did, but the
results aren't out yet

220
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,729
But I'm relieved for now

221
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,689
You can sleep all you
want starting today.

222
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,983
Good fortune comes to those
who sleep and wait!

223
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,527
You're right. I'll sleep
for about 10 hours

224
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,739
After we eat, will you go
over to Yujiro's place

225
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,200
for a little bit? He's
having a hard time.

226
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,035
Okay

227
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,248
After that, I'm going over
to Makoto's place

228
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,752
ilium Are you going to have
monja with someone?

229
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,962
Something to do
with dancing.

230
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,047
With Yuka and the others?

231
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,884
His name is Ken..

232
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,343
Is he your boyfriend?

233
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,887
Mo, he's not!

234
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,180
Your boyfriend?

235
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,639
I said, he's not!

236
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,058
He's not!

237
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,102
How long?

238
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,937
He's not

239
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,940
Ishida Yujiro/Yuzo

240
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,650
For one thing

241
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,360
I'll have another

"You make one mistake, and
you cause a lot of trouble

254
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,471
all over the place.

255
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,097
Do you understand?

256
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,975
That's why you can't
find yourself a wife.

257
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,853
That's something
to worry bout

258
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,522
Don't you have
a girlfriend?

259
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,649


260
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,400
It's nothing to
brag about

261
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,237
Are you seeing
someone, Yujiro?

262
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,280


263
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,866
ibyi^jr/iio?

264
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,995
That's a good idea

265
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,500
If someone like Hitomi
would marry Yuzo

266
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,335
I couldn't ask
for more

267
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,921
I feel bad for Hitomi,
but it would be

268
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,422
good for Yuzo

269
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,883
Not you, too, Ume?

270
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,845
Won't you consider?

271
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,556
Please let us call you
"mistress" in the future

272
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,392
No. I don't think so!
It's impossible

273
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,727
It's impossible

274
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,563
You heard what
everyone said.

275
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,357
She's embarrassed

276
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,485
I'm not embarrassed because
it'll never happen.

277
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,487
If you'll excuse me, I have
something to do.

278
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,613
Take care, Yujiro

279
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,116
I'll come with you

280
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,909
Where are you going?

Come back here!

285
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,877
Grab hold of him!

286
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,919
My honey..

287
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,968
Hitomi was excited that
she was going to meet

288
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,887
Ken whom she admired

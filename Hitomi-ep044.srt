00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,513
CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 44

3
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,940
Akira's classmate, Naoko
came to the house.

4
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,160
Hitomi was so curious about
what their relationship was,

5
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,600
she couldn't contain herself.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,700
I'll leave this here for you.

7
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,320
Thank you very much.

8
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,100
This is for you, Akira.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,520
If this is not enough,
we have lots more.

10
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,530
Here are the cookies.

11
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,940
Naoko, where do you live?

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,460
I live in a condo near
Nishi Nakabashi.

13
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,060
Then you live nearby...

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,520
Were you always
in the same class?

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,700
No... only since we started
our third year.

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,660
I'm the student in charge
of the school library: I asked him

17
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,880
to come to one of our
reading sessions, and he came.

18
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh... so you went?

19
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,940
Well..

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,140
we're trying to study.

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Right.

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,940
Sorry. Do your best.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,120
Bye.

24
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,320
So she's your dad's
granddaughter.

25
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,760
Since mom died, she came
from Sapporo

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
she's helping to
take care of us.

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,260
That's good... she's
like an older sister to you.

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
You must think it's
strange here...

29
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,080
No, looks lively and fun.

30
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,920
Shall we study?

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,680
She loves books?

32
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,240
That's right.

33
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,680
She has good manners
for a kid these days,

34
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,860
and she seems quiet.

35
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,460
That's probably why she
and Akira get along.

36
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,080
But from what I could see,
she's not quite his

37
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,360
girlfriend yet.

38
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,020
They seem to be interested
in each other, but they're

39
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
still just friends.

40
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,580
Hitomi... of course,
they're just friends.

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,500
They're still in middle school.

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,300
Never mind... dinner is
ready, so go and call them.

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,300
Ok... ah!

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Should I invite Naoko for dinner?

45
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,100
That's a good idea!

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,060
I wonder who's calling

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Hashimoto Junko

48
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,460
Hello Junko, what happens?

49
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,920
What a surprise!

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,820
In my room is happening
something unexpected

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
Come as soon as you can.

52
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,560
Now??!

53
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,540
I'll meet you at the station.

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,420
Wait a moment. What is this
unexpected happening?

55
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,760
Just hurry, and some. Bye!

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,620
Junko, wait!

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,820
She hang up.

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,880
Is Junko that girl who came
at the pot stew party?

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,620
Yes.

60
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,860
What happened?

61
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,580
I don't know what happened,
but it's ok if I go?

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,260
I guess it's ok.

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,860
Sorry.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Ah, my bag!

65
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,200
Dinner is ready, everyone!

66
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,840
Dinner...

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
This is it.

68
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,900
Tell me what happened
before I go in.

69
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,460
I want to share my
shock with you.

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,129
If I tell you, you can't
share it, can you?

71
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,898
What's going on anyway?

72
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,267
Let's just go in.

73
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,270
Come on in.

74
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,243
What a cute place.

75
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,119
There's nothing
unusual here.

76
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,060
That...

77
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,135
Yuka?

78
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,870
Hey, Hitomi!

79
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,640
Were you two that close?

80
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,008
Of course not!

81
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,443
That's why I'm shocked.

82
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,011
Do you believe this? She
wants me to let her

83
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,379
stay here tonight.

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,647
Don't just say for tonight...

85
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,282
Let me stay here for
two or three days...

86
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,017
It could even
be for a week.

87
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,220
Listen here... I work
part-time at a pub

88
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,855
four nights a week.

89
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,723
You were lucky I wasn't
at work today, but

90
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,391
sometimes I get home in
the middle of the night.

91
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,459
Don't worry about me...

92
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,094
I'll be here to watch
the place or you.

93
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,196
Were you kicked out
of your house?

94
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,699
No... I left home.

95
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,368
I had a fight
with my dad.

96
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,671
I thought of going to
your house, but

97
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,373
you have children here
so I thought it would

98
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,308
be too much of an
imposition.

99
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,711
So why don't you stay
at a hotel?

100
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,745
You have a credit card,
don't you?

101
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,347
I made up my mind
not to use it.

102
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,748
It's paid out of my
dad's account, so

103
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,717
don't you think that
would be vexing?

104
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,985
So what are you
going to do?

105
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,987
Let me stay here until
things cool down.

106
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,659
You know what?

107
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,561
After taking a bath,
I'm hungry.

108
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,431
So what?

109
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,766
You're from Utsonomiya,
aren't you?

110
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,134
Don't you have any "gyoza"?
(Potstickers / Chinese dumplings)

111
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,004
Of course I do... That's
our family business.

112
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,072
They won't send me a penny,
but they'll send me all

113
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,008
the "gyoza" I want.

114
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,010
Let's have some of that.

115
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,778
Make some for me.

116
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,815
Why don't you just
make some for her?

117
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,550
She says she doesn't
have any money.

118
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,652
You sure are spoiled.

119
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,389
Just make yourself at home
at someone else's place.

120
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,603
It's good.

121
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,305
It's really delicious.

122
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,372
Thanks.

123
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,508
Try to get along...

124
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,376
Just think of it as fate.

125
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,512
It would be childish to
kick her out, so I'll

126
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,280
let her stay, but I'm not
going to talk to her

127
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,882
as much as possible.

128
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,318
I don't want to come home,
and fight too.

129
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,087
Would you like more?

130
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,255
Thanks.

131
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,858
The soup is ready.

132
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,126
How thoughtful.

133
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:17,896
Is it good?

134
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,464
It's really good.

135
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,799
I'm glad.

136
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm home!

137
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,300
Welcome back!

138
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,346
Hitomi... your dinner is
in the refrigerator.

139
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,482
Sorry... I had "gyoza"
at Junko's place.

140
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,118
I'll eat tomorrow
morning. Thanks.

141
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,054
What was Junko's
emergency?

142
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,290
You won't believe this...

143
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,425
It seems Yuka had a fight
with her father, and

144
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,928
she asked Junko to put
her up at her place.

145
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,998
She said it's just for a
few days, so I'm sure

146
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,633
it's ok, but...

147
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,036
Junko didn't know what
to do, so she wanted me

148
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,338
to come over, and listen
to Yuka's story.

149
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,775
What about Naoko?

150
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,778
She went home
before dinner.

151
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,413
It was already dark.

152
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Akira saw her home.

153
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,251
Way to go, Akira.

154
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,689
But the funny thing is...

155
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,425
When Momoko and Keiko
found boyfriends,

156
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,861
I felt as though those
boyfriend were taking

157
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,898
them from me, I felt like
they were my rivals...

158
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,869
But it's different
with a boy...

159
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,739
I just think... has he grown
up that much already?

160
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,877
I feel like he accomplished
something, and it makes

161
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,345
me happy.

162
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,481
You're a male parent after all.

163
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,284
Shall I do that?

164
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,391
Are you home, Katsu?

165
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,626
I'm home.

166
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,094
What is it?

167
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,664
Will you go with me
to Matsuri...?

168
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,933
Just for a little while.

169
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,735
Not again? Go by yourself.

170
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,403
I'll just be in the
way, won't I?

171
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,638
What are you saying?

172
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,239
I went to Kamakura with
Mari on Sunday, and

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,674
we talked the whole day long...

174
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,410
So I don't have anything
more to talk about.

175
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,012
I don't have anything
to talk about either.

176
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,280
You must have something...

177
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,382
Maybe about shirt designs
or something...

178
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,683
Just talk about anything.

179
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,752
Please! You're my
friend, aren't you?

180
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,420
I want to see her, but
the worst thing is not

181
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,255
having anything to
talk about.

182
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,323
Please!

183
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,927
I do feel like
having a drink.

184
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,765
Hitomi... is it okay if
! go out for a while?

185
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,034
Go right ahead.

186
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,602
Thanks, Hitomi.

187
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,504
I'll borrow him then.

188
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,107
I'm not an umbrella you can
borrow for a sudden shower.

189
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,642
Let's go.

190
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,710
I'll be right back.

191
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,859
Mari... dewdrops are popular
in shirt designs these days.

192
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,395
Dewdrops?

193
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,798
They think it's retro, so
it's quite popular with

194
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,501
the young crowd.

195
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,804
Dewdrops are cute,
aren't they?

196
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,706
Yes, they are.

197
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,075
They're really cute.

198
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,014
Also, speaking of shirts...

199
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,851
Checkered shirts are as
popular as ever...

200
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,754
Checkered shirts, huh?

201
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,758
That's standard, isn't it?

202
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,827
That's right... it's standard, isn't it?

203
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,168
Do you want some
rolled eggs?

204
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,904
Sounds good.
I'll have one.

205
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,173
I'll make some
for you now.

206
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,411
She knows what my
favorite foods are.

207
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,748
She even knows what order
I like to eat them.

208
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,383
I'm grateful.

209
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,051
I feel like a fool!

210
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,354
Why am I talking about dewdrops
and checkered shirts for

211
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,523
your sake anyway?

212
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,891
Have a drink.

213
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,326
I'll drink my own.

214
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,685
Is he thinking about the
girl who came over today?

215
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,221
It's possible.

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,968
We're leaving now!

217
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,176
So, Akira has a
girlfriend...

218
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,111
He's all grown-up.

219
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,147
I'm leaving, Grandpa!

220
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,882
Be sure to tell Yuka that
the "tsukudani" she gave

221
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,817
me was so delicious,
I ate it all up.

222
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,418
I will!

223
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,454
Be careful!

224
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,558
How nice it to be
young, isn't it?

225
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,095
I feel like singing the
song of youth now.

226
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,630
Go right ahead.

227
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,648
Sano!

228
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,584
Good morning.

229
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,254
I won't interrupt.

230
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,799
Actually I couldn't
sleep last night.

231
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,102
Why not?

232
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,708
When you walked me home
yesterday, you told me

233
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:08,580
about your real father,
didn't you?

234
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,454
I was thinking about
that all night long.

235
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,425
About how it was.

236
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,929
It's okay... just forget
about what I told you.

237
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't forget.

238
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,609
It's sadder than the saddest
stories that I've read up until now.

239
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,017
Hitomi had no idea that
at that moment, Akira

240
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:51,754
was feeling a ripple of
uneasiness in his heart.

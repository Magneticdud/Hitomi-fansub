CHAPTER 12
Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 68

2
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:14,973
Ume!

3
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,142
Ume. What's wrong?
Are you okay?

4
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,944
I'm OK.

5
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,747
No, you're not
You have a fever.

6
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,348
What am I going to do?

7
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,583
Hang on, Ume!

8
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,051
What am I going to do?

9
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,787
The morning after the festival,
Ume collapsed

10
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,255
Ume

11
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,257
Ume?

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,859
What about Ume?

13
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,694
She has a fever
and collapsed

14
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,397
W VeliiVe* ver here
stay there and take

15
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,565
care of her

16
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,834
Wait a minute. I'll e
you talk to Yujiro

17
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,671
Hello... How is she?

18
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,673
What am I going to do?

19
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,608
I put her to bed
MOlf 10|

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,244
You'd better call a doctor

21
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,947
Ume might say she's okay,
but that's how she is

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:00,052
We don't want to take chances,
especially at her age.

23
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,722
How is she?

24
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,526
It's probably just a
summer cold...

25
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,196
Once her fever goes down,
she'll be fine.

26
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,933
It's ri Iseriodsie. ough o
pOt lir in the s 1 a

27
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,736
Make sure she drinks
lots of liquid, and

28
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,739
give her something nutritious and 
easy to digest

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,708
All right.

30
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,147
The fatigue must
be catching up with you

31
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,315
With helping Katsutaro,
and all the work you

32
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,784
did for the festival

33
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,758
re you going to
a ecareo

34
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,061
neig T)ors are for

35
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,665
Don't you have enough
to do already?

36
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,135
Taking care of the children,
and with Katsutaro in

37
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,437
the hospital... If you
overdo it, you'll

38
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,406
collapse again.

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,309
I know.

40
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,078
Why don't you call
your son, Ume?

41
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,948
Let him take care of you.

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,450
Never mind. I don't need
a son like him

43
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,620
You mean you still
don't get along?

44
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,391
That's not good at
a time like this.

45
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,126
You know what they say,
When you grow old,

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,827
Ii len to your
children

47
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,230
Why don't you use this
as a chance to have

48
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,631
him look after you?

49
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,967
He and I don't get along

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,304
It's easier being alone.

51
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,508
You should at least
give him a call.

52
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,112
Even if you don't get
along, family is family.

53
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,293
This is a summer greeting
card he sent to me

54
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,529
There's his cell
phone number

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,264
Give him a call!

56
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,467
But won't Ume be upset
if we do that?

57
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,469
It doesn't matter if
she gets upset

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,805
At a time like this, you
need to notify the family

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,174
Isn't that right? Then give
him a call, Makoto

60
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,476
You want me to?

61
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,112
Of course! You're his
classmate aren't you ?

62
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,315
It would better if you
do it instead of Ume.

63
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,917
You think so?

64
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,320
But he's the department head
at some big company now.

65
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,289
I haven't talked
to him recently

66
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,025
Do you think I should
use polite language?

67
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,027
That's not necessary.

68
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,896
Just start off with "Hey,
it's been a while"

69
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,131
Something like that

70
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,133
I see. Ail right.

71
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,604
Do you have the number?

72
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,072
That's right..

73
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,941
Gi eme a Teak.

74
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,610
Can you do it?

75
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,811
Wrong number

76
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,766
Department Head Yokoyama..

77
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,433
It's time for the
department meeting

78
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:02,701
Let me take a short
break first

79
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,102
Let me take a short
break first

80
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,339
I've been in a meeting with the
vice president all morning
Yokoyama Tetsuo

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,639
I've been in a meeting with the
vice president all morning
Yokoyama Tetsuo

82
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,074
Give me five minutes.

83
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,520
This is Yokoyama

84
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,323
Hey! It's been a while.
It's me.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,925
It's me... It's me...

86
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,231
He hung up

87
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,935
You have to give
your name first..

88
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,403
Didn't I tell him
my name?

89
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,839
You just kept saying
It's me, it's me.'

90
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,043
I thought I told
him my name.

91
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,456
Hello!

92
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,993
I'm sorry, but I don't
know any Makoto..

93
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,429
Makoto?

94
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,999
It's you! It's been
a while

95
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,205
My mom?

96
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,975
I just thought I should
let you know..

97
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,612
No, not at all...

98
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,750
Excuse me. I'm sorry to
bother you at work.

99
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,552
OK, goodbye

100
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,456
What did he say

101
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,894
All he said was "I see.
Thank you very much."

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,931
Did he say anything about...

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,967
He didn't mention
anything like that

104
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,535
He said something
about being busy

105
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,904
I needfc rin i /a er

106
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,673
We have barley tea.

107
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,650
His wife is the daughter
of a company director?

108
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,719
ha's after that
they started favoring him,

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,721
and he moving
up the company ladder

110
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,157
his father-in-law put down
the deposit on their

111
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,758
big mansion, too.

112
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,394
Do you think he
^len^etk d?

113
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,130
That's possible. I think
it's very visible

114

1 n ew ear a

116
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,071
I ran into them on
their way home

117
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,174
I told him that our shop
was open, so to stop by

118
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,608
and have monja

119
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,877
Tetsuo looked like he
wanted to, but..

120
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,412
His wife didn't
want to?

121
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,814
That's right.

122
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,382
She said, "We have an
engagement to have

123
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,251
dinner in Ginza today"
and she pulled Tetsuo

124
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,686
by the arm.

125
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,023
He brushed her arm off,
and told her, "I'm a

126
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,725
Tsukishima man, and
I want to eat monja

127
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,260
and I'm going to eat it
And so will our son"

128
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,562
He said that?

129
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,796
No, he didn't

130
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,133
He just gave in to his
wife, and told me

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,901
"We're going to
Ginza today"

132
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,071
He had his nose in the air
and went off to Ginza.

133
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,307
He's definitely
hen-pecked

134
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,878
I wonder if that's what Ume's
upset with Tetsuo about

135
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,781
He's turned his back on
Tsukishima, and let

136
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,050
his wife run the roost

137
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,953
Do you mean the typical
frpu 1 between the

138
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,387
bride and the mother-in-law?

139
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,489
That, too

140
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,893
You can tell that his wife
and Ume won't get along.

141
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,862
That's true..

142
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,166
Hey there Yurie!

143
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,835
Did you go to the pool?

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,670
I swam 27 yards.

145
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,205
That's great.

146
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,474
We're going to see a
play, aren't we?

147
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,643
Want to, but.

148
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,946
Go ahead. I'll keep
an eye on Ume

149
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,516
I'll watch the store

150
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,118
Are you sure?

151
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,053
Shall we go after
lunch then?

152
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,389
Aren't you glad?

153
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,224

154
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,735

No... when he was little, he

159
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,449

Making you work because he
had to stay in the hospital

Why couldn't he get hurt without
dragging everybody else into it?

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,401
That's not true

illness"

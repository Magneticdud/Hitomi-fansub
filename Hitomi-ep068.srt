CHAPTER 12
Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 68

2
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:14,973
Ume!

3
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,142
Ume. What's wrong?
Are you okay?

4
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,944
I'm OK.

5
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,747
No, you're not
You have a fever.

6
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,348
What am I going to do?

7
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,583
Hang on, Ume!

8
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,051
What should I do?

9
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,787
The morning after the festival,
Ume collapsed

10
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,255
Ume?

11
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,257
Ume did?

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,859
What about Ume?

13
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,694
She has a fever
and collapsed

14
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,397
We're fine over here
You stay there and take

15
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,565
care of her

16
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,834
Wait a minute. I'll hand
the phone to Yujiro

17
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,671
Hello... How is she?

18
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,673
What should I do?

19
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,608
For now, I put her to bed
and she's sleeping

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,244
You'd better call a doctor

21
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,947
Ume might say she's okay,
but that's how she is

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:00,052
We don't want to take chances,
especially at her age.

23
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,722
How is she?

24
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,526
It seems like a
summer cold...

25
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,196
Once her fever goes down,
she'll be fine.

26
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,933
It's not something that 
requires going to the hospital

27
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,736
Make sure she drinks
lots of liquid, and

28
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,739
give her something nutritious and 
easy to digest

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,708
All right.

30
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,147
The fatigue must
be catching up with you

31
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,315
With helping Katsutaro,
and all the work you

32
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,784
did for the festival

33
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,758
Hitomi, are you able to
take care of her?

34
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,061
That's what neighbors are for

35
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,665
Don't you have enough
to do already?

36
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,135
Taking care of the children,
and with Katsutaro in

37
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,437
the hospital... If you
overdo it, you'll

38
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,406
collapse again.

39
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,309
I know.

40
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,078
Why don't you call
your son, Ume?

41
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,948
Let him take care of you.

42
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,450
Never mind. I don't need
a son like him

43
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,620
You mean you still
don't get along?

44
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,391
That's not good at
a time like this.

45
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,126
You know what they say,
When you grow old,

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,827
it's time to rely on
your children

47
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,230
Why don't you use this
as a chance to have

48
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,631
him look after you?

49
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,967
He and I don't get along

50
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,304
It's easier being alone.

51
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,508
You should at least
give him a call.

52
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,112
Even if you don't get
along, family is family.

53
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,293
This is a summer greeting
card he sent to me

54
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,529
There's his cell
phone number

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,264
Give him a call!

56
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,467
But won't Ume be upset
if we do that?

57
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,469
It doesn't matter if
she gets upset

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,805
At a time like this, you
need to notify the family

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,174
Isn't that right? Then give
him a call, Makoto

60
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,476
You want me to?

61
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,112
Of course! You're his
classmate aren't you?

62
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,315
It would better if you
do it instead of Ume.

63
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,917
You think so?

64
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,320
But he's the department head
at some big company now.

65
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,289
I haven't talked
to him recently

66
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,025
Do you think I should
use polite language?

67
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,027
That's not necessary.

68
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,896
Just start off with "Hey,
it's been a while"

69
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,131
Something like that

70
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,133
I see. All right.

71
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,604
Do you have the number?

72
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,072
That's right..

73
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,941
Give me a break.

74
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,610
Can you do it?

75
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,811
Wrong number.

76
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,766
Department Head Yokoyama..

77
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,433
It's time for the
department meeting

78
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:02,701
Let me take a short
break first

79
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,102
Let me take a short
break first

80
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,339
I've been in a meeting with the
vice president all morning
Yokoyama Tetsuo

81
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,639
I've been in a meeting with the
vice president all morning
Yokoyama Tetsuo

82
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,074
Give me five minutes.

83
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,520
This is Yokoyama

84
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,323
Hey! It's been a while.
It's me.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,925
It's me... It's me...

86
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,231
He hung up!

87
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,935
You have to give
your name first..

88
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,403
Didn't I tell him
my name?

89
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,839
You just kept saying
"It's me, it's me" like a scam.

90
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,043
I thought I told
him my name.

91
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,456
Hello!

92
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,993
I'm sorry, but I don't
know any Makoto..

93
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,429
Makoto?

94
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,999
It's you! It's been
a while!

95
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,205
My mom did?

96
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,975
I just thought I should
let you know..

97
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,612
No, not at all...

98
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,750
Excuse me. I'm sorry to
bother you at work.

99
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,552
OK, goodbye

100
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,456
What did he say?

101
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,894
All he said was "I see.
Thank you very much."

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,931
Did he say anything about
coming for a visit?

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,967
He didn't mention
anything like that

104
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,535
He said something
about being busy

105
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,904
I need another 
glass of water

106
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,673
We have barley tea.

107
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,650
His wife is the daughter
of a company director?

108
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,719
After that they 
started favoring him,

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,721
and he moved up the 
ladder at the company fast

110
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,157
his father-in-law put down
the deposit on their

111
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,758
big mansion, too.

112
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,394
Do you think he's a
"hen pecked" husband?

113
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,130
That's possible. I think
it's very possible.

114
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,800
Once at the New Year, Tetsuo
brought his wife and son

115
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,536
here to visit Ume

116
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,071
I ran into them on
their way home

117
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,174
I told him that our shop
was open, so stop by

118
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,608
and have monja

119
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,877
Tetsuo looked like he
wanted to, but..

120
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,412
His wife didn't
want to?

121
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,814
That's right.

122
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,382
She said, "We have an
engagement to have

123
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,251
dinner in Ginza today"
and she pulled Tetsuo

124
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,686
by the arm.

125
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,023
He brushed her arm off,
saying, "I'm a

126
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,725
Tsukishima man, and
I'm going to eat monja

127
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,260
And so will
you and our son"

128
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,562
He said that?

129
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,796
No, he didn't

130
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,133
He just gave in to his
wife, and told me

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,901
"We're going to
Ginza today"

132
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,071
He had his nose in the air
and went off to Ginza.

133
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,307
He's definitely
hen-pecked

134
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:59,878
I wonder if that's what Ume's
upset with Tetsuo about

135
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,781
He's turned his back on
Tsukishima, and let

136
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,050
his wife run the roost

137
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,953
Do you mean the typical
friction between

138
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,387
bride and the mother-in-law?

139
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,489
There's that, too

140
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,893
You can tell that his wife
and Ume won't get along.

141
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,862
That's true..
They're completely different!

142
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,166
Hey there Yurie!

143
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,835
Did you go to the pool?

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,670
I swam 25 yards.

145
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,205
That's great.

146
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,474
We're going to visit Dad
in the hospital, aren't we?

147
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,643
I want to, but...

148
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,946
Go ahead. I'll keep
an eye on Ume

149
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,516
I'll watch the store

150
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,118
Are you sure?

151
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,053
Shall we go after
lunch then?

152
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,389
Aren't you glad?

153
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,224
Thank you!

154
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,735
Ume and her son
aren't getting along

155
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,206
Ume's reluctant and
awfully stiff when

156
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,707
it comes to her son...

157
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,643
Was she always
like that?

158
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,481
No... when he was little,
they had a good relationship.

159
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,449
When he started middle
school, his dad died

160
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,786
He suddenly started
studying hard...

161
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:19,324
He was in the newspaper
one of those, "student style"

162
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,330
Then he got his first job 
in a company. She told us

163
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:30,335
he took her out to eat when he
got his first paycheck.

164
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,639
I think he started acting
cold toward her after

165
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,808
he got married.

166
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,010
There are a lot of
circumstances between

167
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,646
parents and kids. They 
should try to get along.

168
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,652
You're one to talk, Grandpa!

169
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,895
Shota... Did you finish
your drawing?

170
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,463
I'm almost done

171
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,799
Your grandson's a good artist, isn't he!

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,234
He's not my grandson...
he's my son.

173
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,509
My son and my daughter

174
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,012
This is my granddaughter

175
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,568
Good evening!

176
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,205
Hello, Momoko.

177
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,642
Where's Hitomi? I thought
I'd come to help with something

178
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,310
She's over at
Ume's place.

179
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,412
She has a fever so Hitomi
is her caregiver.

180
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,948
So I'm in charge of
the children tonight.

181
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,916
Is that right?

182
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,951
Let's eat

183
00:10:55,554 --> 00:11:00,091
Well...in that case, 
I'm not needed here.

184
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,699
Thank you for the meal

185
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,968
You've gotten your
appetite back

186
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,037
And your fever went down, too

187
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,338
It must be the medicine

188
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,140
Here you go.

189
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,741
Thanks

190
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,176
I'll wash these.

191
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,049
I feel bad getting you
to help, too, Momoko

192
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,318
What are you saying, what
are neighbors for?

193
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,093
It's probably Dad's fault
that you got sick.

194
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,396
Making you work because he
had to stay in the hospital

195
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,599
Why couldn't he get hurt without
dragging everybody else into it?

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,401
That's not true

197
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,603
It's just the 'demon
illness"

198
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,572
Good evening

199
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,274
I'll get it.

200
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,581
Who are you?

201
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,651
Ume's son... This is
my home

202
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,387
Ume

203
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,189
Your son

204
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,960
It's been a while, Mom..
Makoto told me

205
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,367
Tetsuo!

206
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,303
Momoko!

207
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,772
It's been a while

208
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,007
This is my daughter

209
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,210
Is that right?

210
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,879
Pleased to meet you
I'm Hitomi

211
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,047
I'm Yokoyama.

212
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,015
Anyway, come on in

213
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,053
I got it

214
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,329
Here you go.

215
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,798
Sorry...serving me
in my own home.

216
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,871
Mom, when things are this bad,
couldn't you let me know?

217
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,840
What's it to you?

218
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,476
I'm your son, aren't I!

219
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,148
You should call me at least once
before asking the neighbors

220
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,619
She didn't want
you to worry

221
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,025
It really has been a
long time, hasn't it?

222
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,029
When did you come here?

223
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,331
Some months ago... I have an
office here now.

224
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,366
What about you?

225
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,768
I'm still working for the 
real estate company

226
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,171
You're an important man
now, aren't you?

227
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,941
I'm working on a shopping
development in Tama

228
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,543
that will open year
after  next

229
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,645
I'm in charge of assembling
tenants for the shopping

230
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,181
center, so every day 
is really busy 

231
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,082
just meeting with
a lot of people

232
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,784
Hitomi...

233
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,686
Yes 

234
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,022
Will you take the
tea away?

235
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,490
He'll be leaving soon.

236
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,826
What are you saying?

237
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,427
We've hardly talked yet

238
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,730
I don't have anything
to say to you

239
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,432
I know what you're
going to say already

240
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,568
I worry about you

241
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,303
I don't want anything to
happen to you.

242
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,572
Living all alone,

243
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,340
this kind of thing
is a given..

244
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,743
Bothering our
neighbors like this

245
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,946
We have a room for you

246
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,747
It'll be a lot easier
for you than living

247
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,249
here in the tenement.

248
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,585
I don't want to

249
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,086
No matter what anyone
says, I love it here

250
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,021
in the tenement.

251
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,891
Just go home already
You'll raise my fever 

252
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,796
I'll leave for today.

253
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,831
But I'm coming back.

254
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,269
I'll leave this here - 
it's a melon.

255
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,005
I don't want your melon.

256
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,242
It costs $100, you know!

257
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,511
Excuse me.

258
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,580
Goodbye.

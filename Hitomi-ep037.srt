CHAPTER 7
Let's Be Friends"
Episode 37

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,926
Raising Akira. Yuria and
Shota has something to

3
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,061
do with me

4
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,399
I'm going to
quit dancing

5
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,903
Doing both is you
isn' t?

6
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,073
Be presumptuous, and
keep dancing.

7
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,709
It's finished

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,180
The point is how to find the
time for you to dance

9
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,617
With this, you won't have
to overdo it, and you can

10
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,586
manage to keep on
dancing, can't you?

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,288
Don't cry, Hitomi!

12
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,859
April, 2007

13
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,135
In order to give Hitomi time
to dance, the children had

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,871
divided up the housework

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,911
Listen carefully Shota.

16
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,579
Don't think of it as
something you don't

17
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,214
want to do because
it's housework.

18
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,516
It's our duty...

19
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,050
In other words,
it's our mission

20
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,752
Answer me by saying,
"roger".

21
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,820
Say it.

22
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,921
Roger!

23
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,056
All right.

24
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,660
Let's go.

25
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,530
Good morning, Hitomi.

26
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,031
Good morning.

27
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,432
What are you all
doing here?

28
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,468
We're here because...
it's our mission.

29
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,603
Your morning mission...

30
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,772
Everybody will hang
the laundry.

31
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,440
Roger!

32
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,646
Next, Shota.

33
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,014
Roger!

34
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,448
Next. Shota.

35
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,449
Roger!

36
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,951
Roger...

37
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,092
Mornings became even more
efficient than before.

38
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,794
This is next. Shota

39
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,129
Roger!

40
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,300
Roger...

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,181
It's really a great help to have
them helping out like this.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,386
That's how much they all
want your to keep dancing.

43
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,830
Aren't you lucky? You can
go back to dancing again.

44
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,967
I owe it all to
the children.

45
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,803
That's true, but don't
you also owe it to that

46
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,705
teacher, Ray, too?

47
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,843
She came down here just to give you encouragement.

48
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,447
Dancing and taking care
of the children are

49
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,584
what make you Ippongi Hitomi...

50
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,588
Isn't what she said?

51
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,091
I'll have to find some way to thank Ray for that.

52
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,693
Hello!

53
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,663
! came to talk to Yu today.

54
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,665
Me?

55
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,167
The Sunday after
next Sunday...

56
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,104
In other words, will you be free the
week after next Sunday, Yu?

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,439
I'm free... It's our day
off, so I'm totally free.

58
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,774
What is it?

59
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,577
If you're free, shall we go
somewhere faraway (toude)?

60
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,112
Toude”?

61
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,581
If yo flip it around, it comes
out to "detou" (date).

62
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,450
Sure, it's okay. Let's go
on a "detou" somewhere

63
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,918
faraway (toude)...

64
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,421
I'm so glad you're free.

65
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:53,025
Actually, my fortune said if
I go somewhere faraway on

66
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,594
that Sunday, something
good will happen.

67
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,064
Will you think of where we can go?

68
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,599
I'll think about it, too.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
Ok, I'll think about it.
I'll stay up all night,

70
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,502
and think about it.

71
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,203
Well talk out
it later then.

72
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,838
Lets do that.

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
See you!

74
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,976
Goodbye!

75
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,745
Thank you!

76
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,182
Flip it around, and
it means "date"?

77
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,186
That's mine, Dad!

78
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,932
Ray!

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,367
What is it?

80
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,135
Thank you for coming all the way to

81
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,403
my part-time job to talk to me

82
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,672
Thanks to you, I found the
spirit to come back

83
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,840
to dancing again.

84
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,208
It's okay.

85
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,276
Is that all?

86
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,714
It's not much as a token of apology, but...

87
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,220
Please continue to teach
me from now on.

88
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,761
There's going to be
an audition...

89
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,896
The alumni from this class,
d-Darts are g Ing to make

90
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,565
a promotion video.

91
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,736
And they're looking for
background dancers.

92
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,407
Quiet down, everyone

93
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,111
So they've notified dance
schools throughout Tokyo,

94
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,247
and asked them to recommend
20 dancers from each school

95
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,919
And HIPZ has decided to
recommend this whole class.

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,025
Hashimoto Junko

97
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,927
Kitagawa Yuka

98
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,963
Calm down.

99
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,097
Don't be too happy...

100
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,399
You're just being recommended...

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
You haven't been chosen yet.

102
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,468
They're looking for an
original dance to the

103
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,837
beat of the d-Darts'
debut song.

104
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,473
It can be a solo or a group.

105
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,409
The deciding battle
will be next Friday

106
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,177
The place will be
Club BROCKS.

107
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,914
It'll be like a battle
between schools

108
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,851
I want you all to uphold
the reputation of HIPZ,

109
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,420
and do your best.

110
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,925
This is a first chance
for all of you, and

111
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,794
I think it'll be a
good experience

112
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,096
I won't complain...

113
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,699
Come up with your own ideas
to choreograph your dance.

114
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,906
Today, one of the judges
is here to greet you.

115
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,870
Those of you who attended
the d-Darts' debut event

116
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,772
last month have already
met him, but this is

117
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,774
Ken, one of my old
dance partners.

118
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,844
Heìll be in charge of
choreographing the

119
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,278
promotion video.

120
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,882
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you can do

121
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,362
I think it's awesome that
Ken is going to be one

122
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,630
of the judges.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,365
I'm all fired up.

124
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,567
What is it?

125
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,036
I found this picture
on the lnternet.

126
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,543
I knew that Ken and Ray used
to dance as a unit, but this

127
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,012
is the first time I've seen
a picture of them.

128
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,016
The legendary dance
unit, CHEAPASS...

129
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,318
They never came out on
television, but they

130
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,487
were really popular
at the dance clubs.

131
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,858
They were both really
young, weren't they?

132
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,261
It was seven years ago...

133
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,063
Ray was 18, and
Ken was 23.

134
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,235
Who is this.

135
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,306
That's Eiji... He was a
really close friend of

136
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,276
Ken, but he died in a
motorcycle accident

137
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,011
three years ago.

138
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,949
So CHEAPASS broke up, and
Ken went to New York alone.

139
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,153
Everyone thought that
he wouldn't come back.

140
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,323
Is that what happened?

141
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,691
That's why it's so awesome.

142
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,660
He not only came back, but
he's going to be a judge

143
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,662
for the background dancers.

144
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,263
I'll have to do my best
with a person like that

145
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,431
as a judge.

146
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:27,899
That's right.

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,769
Pass the audition, and become
the talk of the town, Hitomi.

148
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,372
So who are you going
to dance with?

149
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,144
You're not planning to go solo, are you?

150
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,647
That's the problem...

151
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,485
Kyoko, and those two have
formed their own unit...

152
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,625
Yoshiki and his unit have
no intention of including

153
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,193
a girl in their unit.

154
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,796
There's only...

155
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,033
Those two...?

156
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,337
That's just it.

157
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,544
How about it? Want
to dance with me?

158
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,181
Will you dance
with me?

159
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,983
I have a plan.

160
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,218
Shall we go, and
have tea?

161
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,088
Let's go.

162
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,723
I'm coming!

163
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,861
Our first goal is to win
the audition, of course.

164
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,429
I could do that
alone, but..

165
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,399
I have a vision
beyond that.

166
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,669
And that's... a major debut.

167
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,804
A major debut?

168
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,474
Our goal is to appeal to
Ken and the producer of

169
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,142
the record company.

170
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,979
The way to do that
is to stand out.

171
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,515
That's where you come in.
You're really tall.

172
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,284
You'll make a great weapon
when it comes to impact.

173
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,286
I'm a weapon?

174
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:00,525
And besides, you'lI
emphasize my adorable

175
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,994
and sharp appeal.

176
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,367
Was she praising me?

177
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,836
Nevermind! If you can
pair up with Junko,

178
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,438
it'll be a chance for you.

179
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,041
That's right... If you
audition by yourself,

180
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,976
you don't know if
you'll win. do you?

181
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,678
But if you dance with me,
you're sure to win

182
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,546
the audition, so why not?

183
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,049
That's right... You'll be
the talk of the town.

184
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,053
I see...

185
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,088
I'll be the talk of
the town, won't I?

186
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,623
AII right.

187
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,291
I'll do it, Junko.

188
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,459
Let's work together.

189
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,294
Okay! We'll start
practicing tomorrow.

190
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,766
Why are you here?

191
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,045
Watch your finger...

192
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,149
I'm home!

193
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,954
You're early today,
aren't you?

194
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,623
I was just talking
to my friends today.

195
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,359
Were going to be
auditioning.

196
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,495
That's great

197
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,565
You have to chop
the garlic, Akira.

198
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,700
Roger!

199
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,236
Are the children preparing
dinner all by themselves?

200
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,438
They said they
would do it

201
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,741
They said they can do it if
they have the cookbook,

202
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,244
so I'm just supposed to sit
here, and read the newspaper.

203
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,847
What are we going to do if
it doesn't taste good?

204
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,091
No matter howit tastes,
when you eat it, just

205
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,893
say "it's delicious!"

206
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,095
So you just want me
to flatter them.

207
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,630
Don't call it flattery.

208
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,269
We can't fail this mission
Do you understand?

209
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,838
Stir-fry the meat and the
garlic for 20 seconds,

210
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,273
then put the Vegetables
in right away.

211
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,574
Roger!

212
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,343
Let's do it

213
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,616
Shota... the minced meat!

214
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:12,957
One... two... three... four...
five... six... seven... eight...

215
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,593
It's ready!

216
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,197
This looks delicious.

217
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,033
It's fried rice with stir-fried
Vegetables in a gravy sauce.

218
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,601
Yuria was the one who
suggested that we

219
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,103
try to cook the dinner.

220
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,472
So you can practice your
dancing even more.

221
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,642
Thank you!

222
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,143
Thank you...!

223
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,678
Will you do this everyday?

224
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,614
Don't get carried away.
That's your job.

225
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,384
This is just once
in a while

226
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,585
You're right.

227
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,287
Let's eat.

228
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,064
You cut the vegetables
really nicely.

229
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,202
It's delicious!

230
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,604
I didn't have to
use flattery.

231
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,209
Were you just going
to flatter us?

232
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,012
Hitomi!

233
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,614
Guidance in education.

234
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,988
It's delicious.

235
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,225
Sapporo

236
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,127
So, you're going to
an audition?

237
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,364
Aren't you lucky that the
children are helping you?

238
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,669
After dinner, they even
helped with the ironing.

239
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,039
I guess it's okay then.

240
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,610
As long a the children
are on your side...

241
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,612
Just do your best.

242
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,847
If you collapse doing
what you love to do,

243
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,315
I won't complain.

244
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,851
I'll do my best

245
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,490
Hitomi's first challenge
is about to begin.

00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:07,821
HITOMI

00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,913
CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 37

3
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,561
Raising Akira, Yuria and Shota
has something to do with me.

4
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,399
I'm going to
quit dancing.

5
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,903
Doing both is you,
isn't it?

6
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,073
Be presumptuous, and
keep dancing.

7
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,709
It's finished.

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,180
The point is how to find the
time for you to dance.

9
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,617
With this, you won't have
to overdo it, and you can

10
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,586
manage to keep on
dancing, can't you?

11
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,288
Don't cry, Hitomi!

12
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,859
April, 2007

13
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:20,071
In order to give Hitomi time to dance,
the children had divided up the housework.

14
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,911
Listen carefully, Shota.

15
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,579
Don't think of it as
something you don't

16
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,214
want to do because
it's housework.

17
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,516
It's our duty...

18
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,050
In other words,
it's our mission.

19
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,752
Answer me by saying,
"roger".

20
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,820
Say it.

21
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,921
Roger!

22
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,056
All right.

23
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,660
Let's go.

24
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,530
Good morning, Hitomi.

25
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,031
Good morning.

26
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,432
What are you all
doing here?

27
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,468
We're here because...
it's our mission.

28
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,603
Your morning mission...

29
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,772
Everybody will hang
the laundry.

30
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,440
Roger!

31
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,646
Next, Shota.

32
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,014
Roger!

33
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,448
Next, Shota.

34
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,449
Roger!

35
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,951
Roger...

36
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,592
Mornings became even more
efficient than before.

37
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,294
This is next, Shota

38
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,629
Roger!

39
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,800
Roger...

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,681
It's really a great help to have
them helping out like this.

41
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,886
That's how much they all
want you to keep dancing.

42
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,330
Aren't you lucky? You can
go back to dancing again.

43
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,467
I owe it all to
the children.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,205
That's true, but don't you also
owe it to that teacher, RAY, too?

45
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:04,343
She came down here just to
give you encouragement.

46
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,947
Dancing and taking care
of the children are

47
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:12,084
what make you Ippongi Hitomi...

48
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,088
Isn't what she said?

49
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,591
I'll have to find some
way to thank RAY for that.

50
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,193
Hello!

51
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,163
I came to talk to Yu today.

52
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,165
Me?

53
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,667
The Sunday after
next Sunday...

54
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,604
In other words, will you be free
the week after next Sunday, Yu?

55
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,939
I'm free... It's our day
off, so I'm totally free.

56
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,274
What is it?

57
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,077
If you're free, shall we go
somewhere faraway (toude)?

58
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,612
"Toude”?

59
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,081
If you flip it around, it comes
out to "detou" (date).

60
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,418
Sure, it's okay. Let's go on a
"detou" somewhere faraway (toude)...

61
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,921
I'm so glad you're free.

62
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,525
Actually, my fortune said if
I go somewhere faraway on

63
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,094
that Sunday, something
good will happen.

64
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,564
Will you think of where we can go?

65
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,099
I'll think about it, too.

66
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Ok, I'll think about it.
I'll stay up all night,

67
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,002
and think about it.

68
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,703
We'll talk out
it later then.

69
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,338
Let's do that.

70
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
See you!

71
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,476
Goodbye!

72
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,245
Thank you!

73
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,682
Flip it around, and
it means "date"?

74
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,686
That's mine, Dad!

75
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,432
RAY!

76
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,867
What is it?

77
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,635
Thank you for coming all the way to

78
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,903
my part-time job to talk to me.

79
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,340
Thanks to you, I found the spirit
to come back to dancing again.

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,708
It's okay.

81
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,776
Is that all?

82
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,214
It's not much as a
token of apology, but...

83
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,720
Please continue to teach
me from now on.

84
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:02,261
There's going to be
an audition...

85
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,396
The alumni from this class,
d-Darts are going to make

86
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,065
a promotion video.

87
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,236
And they're looking for
background dancers.

88
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,907
Quiet down, everyone.

89
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,011
So they've notified dance
schools throughout Tokyo,

90
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:23,047
and asked them to recommend
20 dancers from each school.

91
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,419
And HIPZ has decided to
recommend this whole class.

92
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,525
Hashimoto Junko

93
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,427
Kitagawa Yuka

94
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,463
Calm down.

95
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,597
Don't be too happy...

96
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,899
You're just being recommended...

97
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
You haven't been chosen yet.

98
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,968
They're looking for an
original dance to the

99
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,337
beat of the d-Darts'
debut song.

100
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,973
It can be a solo or a group.

101
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,909
The deciding battle
will be next Friday.

102
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,677
The place will be
Club BROCKS.

103
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,414
It'll be like a battle
between schools.

104
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,351
I want you all to uphold
the reputation of HIPZ,

105
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,920
and do your best.

106
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,425
This is a first chance
for all of you, and

107
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,294
I think it'll be a
good experience.

108
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,596
I won't complain...

109
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,199
Come up with your own ideas
to choreograph your dance.

110
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,406
Today, one of the judges
is here to greet you.

111
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,370
Those of you who attended
the d-Darts' debut event

112
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,272
last month have already
met him, but this is

113
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,274
KEN, one of my old
dance partners.

114
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,778
He'll be in charge of
choreographing the promotion video.

115
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,382
I'm looking forward to
seeing what you can do.

116
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,130
I think it's awesome that KEN is
going to be one of the judges.

117
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,865
I'm all fired up.

118
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,067
What is it?

119
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,536
I found this picture
on the Internet.

120
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,043
I knew that KEN and RAY used
to dance as a unit, but this

121
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,512
is the first time I've seen
a picture of them.

122
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,516
The legendary dance
unit, CHEAPASS...

123
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,818
They never came out on
television, but they

124
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,987
were really popular
at the dance clubs.

125
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,358
They were both really
young, weren't they?

126
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,761
It was seven years ago...

127
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,563
RAY was 18, and
KEN was 23.

128
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,735
Who is this?

129
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,806
That's EIJI... He was a
really close friend of KEN,

130
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:05,511
but he died in a motorcycle
accident three years ago.

131
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:11,449
So CHEAPASS broke up, and
Ken went to New York alone.

132
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,653
Everyone thought that
he wouldn't come back.

133
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,823
Is that what happened?

134
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,191
That's why it's so awesome.

135
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,160
He not only came back, but
he's going to be a judge

136
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,162
for the background dancers.

137
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,931
I'll have to do my best with
a person like that as a judge.

138
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,399
That's right.

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,269
Pass the audition, and become
the talk of the town, Hitomi.

140
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:35,172
So who are you going
to dance with?

141
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,644
You're not planning to
go solo, are you?

142
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,147
That's the problem...

143
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,985
Kyoko, and those two have
formed their own unit...

144
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,693
Yoshiki and his unit have no intention
of including a girl in their unit.

145
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,296
There's only...

146
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,533
Those two...?

147
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,837
That's just it.

148
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,044
How about it? Want
to dance with me?

149
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,681
Will you dance
with me?

150
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,483
I have a plan.

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,718
Shall we go, and
have tea?

152
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,588
Let's go.

153
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,223
I'm coming!

154
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,361
Our first goal is to win
the audition, of course.

155
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,929
I could do that
alone, but..

156
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,899
I have a vision
beyond that.

157
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,169
And that's... a major debut.

158
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,304
A major debut?

159
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,642
Our goal is to appeal to KEN and
the producer of the record company.

160
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,479
The way to do that
is to stand out.

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,015
That's where you come in.
You're really tall.

162
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,784
You'll make a great weapon
when it comes to impact.

163
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,786
I'm a weapon?

164
00:10:55,321 --> 00:11:04,494
And besides, you'll emphasize
my adorable and sharp appeal.

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,867
Was she praising me?

166
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,336
Nevermind! If you can
pair up with Junko,

167
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,938
it'll be a chance for you.

168
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,541
That's right... If you
audition by yourself,

169
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,476
you don't know if
you'll win, do you?

170
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,178
But if you dance with me,
you're sure to win

171
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,046
the audition, so why not?

172
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,549
That's right... You'll be
the talk of the town.

173
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,553
I see...

174
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,588
I'll be the talk of
the town, won't I?

175
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,123
AII right.

176
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,791
I'll do it, Junko.

177
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,959
Let's work together.

178
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,794
Okay! We'll start
practicing tomorrow.

179
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,266
Why are you here?

180
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,545
Watch your finger...

181
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,649
I'm home!

182
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,454
You're early today,
aren't you?

183
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,123
I was just talking
to my friends today.

184
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,859
We're going to be
auditioning.

185
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,995
That's great

186
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,065
You have to chop
the garlic, Akira.

187
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,200
Roger!

188
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,736
Are the children preparing
dinner all by themselves?

189
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,938
They said they
would do it.

190
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,241
They said they can do it if
they have the cookbook,

191
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,744
so I'm just supposed to sit
here, and read the newspaper.

192
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,347
What are we going to do if
it doesn't taste good?

193
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,591
No matter how it tastes,
when you eat it, just

194
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,393
say "it's delicious!"

195
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,595
So you just want me
to flatter them.

196
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,130
Don't call it flattery.

197
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,769
We can't fail this mission.
Do you understand?

198
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,338
Stir-fry the meat and the
garlic for 20 seconds,

199
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,773
then put the vegetables
in right away.

200
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,074
Roger!

201
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:57,843
Let's do it

202
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,116
Shota... the minced meat!

203
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:12,457
One... two... three... four...
five... six... seven... eight...

204
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,093
It's ready!

205
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,697
This looks delicious.

206
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,533
It's fried rice with stir-fried
vegetables in a gravy sauce.

207
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,101
Yuria was the one who
suggested that we

208
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,603
try to cook the dinner.

209
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,972
So you can practice your
dancing even more.

210
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,142
Thank you!

211
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,643
Thank you...!

212
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,178
Will you do this everyday?

213
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,114
Don't get carried away.
That's your job.

214
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,884
This is just once
in a while.

215
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,085
You're right.

216
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,787
Let's eat.

217
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,564
You cut the vegetables
really nicely.

218
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,702
It's delicious!

219
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,104
I didn't have to
use flattery.

220
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,709
Were you just going
to flatter us?

221
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,512
Hitomi!

222
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,114
Guidance in education.

223
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,488
It's delicious.

224
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,725
Sapporo

225
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,627
So, you're going to
an audition?

226
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,864
Aren't you lucky that the
children are helping you?

227
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,169
After dinner, they even
helped with the ironing.

228
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,539
I guess it's okay then.

229
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,110
As long as the children
are on your side...

230
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,112
Just do your best.

231
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,347
If you collapse doing
what you love to do,

232
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,815
I won't complain.

233
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,351
I'll do my best.

234
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,990
Hitomi's first challenge
is about to begin.

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,743
Good Morning

6
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
Thank you for
the other day.

7
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,316
Be sure to call me if you
have anything else

00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,584
j :<-1

9
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,289
What is it?

10
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,957
Did something happen?

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,259
You could say that.

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,496
Mom and Grandpa were
drinking together

13
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,764
At Mari's place?

14
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,033
They sure were..

15
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,469
They parted talking about
who you took after, and

16
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,704
whether you had leadership
qualities or not.

17
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,073
Katsu said you took
after him sintt*

18
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,075
he's thele Iter fit
the ftfTis

19
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,744
Momo said you took
after her nee

20
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,881
she's the "FOkUs Ishach '
(assistant branch manager)

21
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,685
Katsu said, "tgko
fuku (clothing) everyday '

22
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,854
ty/hat'^hat?

23
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,389
But they weren't fighting.

24
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,125
It's just an argument
about how much they

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,893
care about you.

26
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,698
They were showing their
feelings of gratitude.

27
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,601
Katsu feels grateful to her
for giving him such

28
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,136
a good granddaughter...

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,204
And Momo's grateful to
him for orr ingthat

30
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,973


31
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,307
They went home
after that, didn't they?

32
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,709
What did they ta1k
to you about?

33
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,079
They both told me to
give anything a try

34
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,716
It felt kind of strange.

35
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,152
It's so unusual for them
to agree on anything

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,155
So what did you tell them7

37
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,490
I told them that I was going
to continue dancing

38
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,792
You're going to
continue

39
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,461
by yourself?

40
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,864

41
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,332

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,234
Thank you.

43
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,472
I just set it up so
they'd be together

44
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,640


45
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,708
They had you to talk
about, so they at

^rvjoqei ler to drink.

47
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,547
Your son's sure been a good
son lately, hasn't he?

48
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,782
With that new hairstyle.

49
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,518
Can I brag a little?

50
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,189
He's really doing
well lately

51
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,426

The next thing is

00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,713
Don't you know
anyone?

60
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,686
Good idea

61
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,061
I'll come back again
Thank you

00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,863
I'll see you again

63
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,289
Hello... Are you making the
rounds of your customers?

64
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,093
I see you're taking
your role seriously

65
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,429
I guess... What did
you expect?

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,064

I'm home!

78
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,585
Welcome home.
Mis Hitomi

79
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,259
We have the same
hairstyle

80
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,062
I thought I'd copy yours

81
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,998
Do we have a guest?

82
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,033
Yuria's friend,
Ms. Sakaino

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,936
She did something
about that

84
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,005
Excuse me!

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,207
A customer

86
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,275
I'll take it.

87
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,443
Will you?

88
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,677
\e s o *t drop it

89
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,254
Yuria, I brought
you a snack

90
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,899
Welcome

91
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,103
This is Hitomi.

92
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,671
She's a really
good dancer.

93
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,906
I'm Sakaino Ryoko

94
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,742
Nice to meet you

95
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,544


96
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,781
Where's Akira?

97
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,716
Reading a quiz book

98
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,451
So you like quizzes?

99
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,255
Ask me something

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,224
Ask something.

101
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,234
Who wote the "The Brothers
Karamazov"?

102
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,271
Karamazov?

103
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,076
I'm sorry...
I don't know

104
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,513
Dostoevsky

105
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,086
You're really knowledgeable,
aren't you?

106
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,321
She knows a lot
of things

107
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,193
Do you live nearby?

108
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,597
Then come and
visit again.

109
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,138
If you want more,
just call me

110
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,807
Thanks

111
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,609
Enjoy your stay.

112
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,157
Be careful on
your way home

113
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,792
See you

114
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,861
Goodbye

115
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,896
See you again

116
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,805
See you tomorrow!

117
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,684
She's really quiet,
isn't she?

118
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,352
She's shy

119
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,421
She doesn't raise her
hand in class, and

120
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,189
if the teacher calls on
her she looks like

121
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,457
she'll start crying

122
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,893
How did you get to be
friends with her?

123
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:15,193
How did you get to be
friends with her?

124
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,829
When we were changing for
phys ed class,

125
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,865
she was the last one
to change.

126
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:20,699
Everyone else left, but I
waited in the hallway

127
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,102
Everyone else left, but I
waited in the hallway.

128
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,105
She must have been happy

129
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,809
I'm glad that you made
friends so easily with

130
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,512
someone who'd come over
to the house and play

131
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,550
I'm home!

132
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,723
I'm hungry!

133
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,763
Out of all the new students,
you're the worst tennis player?

134
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,367
Some of them were playing
since middle school

135
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,502
There's one guy named
Komshi who has a

136
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,937
really strong serve

137
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,539
I can't even hit it

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,008
But you're going to try
your best, aren't you?

139
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,477
I'll still be
the worst player

140
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,279
But it's better
this way.

141
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,915
All you can do is
get better at it

142
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,218
Have you decided which club
you're going to join?

143
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,253
Don't they have
a cake club?

144
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,088
You love baking cakes

145
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,657
There's no such thing.

146
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,525
That's right

147
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,960
Thank you for
the meal

148
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,662
Me, too. Thank you
for the meal

149
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,601
She's really grown

150
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,369
Yuria.

151
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,775
Remember what she was saying
about Ms Sakaino

152
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,745
That's how she was when
she first came here

153
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,650
Maybe that's why she's
so nice to her

154
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,186
She remembers how
she used to be

155
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,324
I'm going to do
my homework

156
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,291
Me, too.

157
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,530
I'd better grow, too.

158
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,433
You don't have to
grow anymore

159
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,435
You'll hit the roof

160
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,637
This way?

161
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,572
That's not what I was
talking about

162
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,011
Hello.

163
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,649
Just a minute.

164
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,086
After I'm doing cleaning up,
can I go out for a bit?

165
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,154
Sure, OK

166
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,760
Mayuge Neko at a
nursery school?

167
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,396
The principal there
happened to see our

168
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,734
last performance and
called Mr Ishn..

169
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,838
They want us to teach
all of the children.

170
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,040
Is that it?

171
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,543
That's the one you put
on the cat's face, and

172
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,978
dance, isn't it?

173
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,214
I always wanted
to see that.

174
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,849
Really?

175
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,417
Just a minute.

176
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,385
You have it

177
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,320
It looks like this.

178
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,589
It's Ken and Ray!

179
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,057
That's right..

180
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,825
Look at this

181
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,130
She's so cute

182
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,599
Send that to her
cell phone

183
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,334
You can't do that!

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,635
You have to get

costumes either

3
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,831
Shot a

4
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,715
How's Shota?

5
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,817
He's iying down,
-and crying

6
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:02,888
Yuria*

7
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,158
Why did /feu do something
like this? You're his

8
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,726
older sister "tent you?

9
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,496
Because Shota was mean

10
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,565
What do you mean?

11
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,736
He wouldn't tell me
about his mother

12
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,407
And he wouldn't tell me what
he talked !o her about

13
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,451
It's been along time
since Shota's seen

14
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:38,457
his mother, 5nd he haT
a lot to think about

15
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:45,030
And he s having a nard time
putting it into words

16
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:52,838
i know you want to hear
what happened, but give

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,040
him a little more time

18
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,477
He's not trying
to be mean

19
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,748
You have to make
up with him

20
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,337
Yuria thought you were
trying to be mean

21
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,006
because you wouldn't tell
her about your mother

22
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,943
ut it's not that, is it?

23
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,015
Then will you two
make up9

24
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,352
If the two of yotf arjfe4'
fighting, Akira won f

25
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,221
be able to study

26
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,824
Make up with
each other

27
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,062
Shall we shake hands,
and make up9

28
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,997
Shake hands..

29
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,865
Jo: I //or»'f
shake hands.

30
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,201
Yuria*

31
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,577
Why 9

32
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,485
Why did it turn
out like this?

33
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,196
'ji*I /»i
tarted fighting?

34
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,033
They haveri t made up...

35
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,005
No matter how hard Grandpa
tries, he couldn't

36
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,140
resolve the fight.

37
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,613
This is the first time
hardly anyone talked

38
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,615
during dinner, too

39
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,153
Ma be Yuria's feeling
a little jealous.

40
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,690
Because Shota went
to see his mother

41
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,626
Yuria s pr T>ably
fe ling lonely

42
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,598
This is wh 11 you
should step in.

43
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,269
Even If everyone else
is tense, you have

44
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,272
to stay che Trful, and
brighten up the house

45
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,209
That's true...

46
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,548
That's what I think, too,
but I just don't know

47
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,218
what to do

48
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,897
Shota really is adorable

49
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,866
Having seen fm^gain.
I realize ttf^J

50
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,002

When 1 got home
I was so happy.

117
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,038
Because didn't call,
they all knew that

118
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,208
I failed the audition, so
they just acted normal

119
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,344
when I came home.

120
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,183

and no matter what happens
life will go on like this

124
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:12,877
everyday and it made me
realize that I can do my

125
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,314
best as long as \ have a place
like this to come home to

126
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,216
it cheered me up a little

127
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,221
I'm sure it's the same
for the children, too

128
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,957
You have to make a place
like that for them

129

y any chance
Is'Yuka drunk?

180
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,146
opelessly drunk...

181
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,282
he s been drinking
y herself all night

182
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,850
So who are those guys?

183
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,685
they're fighting
over Yuka

184
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,788
The two guys in the red
and orange tried to

185
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,657
pick Yuka up first

186
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,259
After that when Yuka was
dancing by herself the

187
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,295
in the green and
two guys
light blue jackets

188
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,963
tried to Pick her

189
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,798
In others words, the red
and the orange are

190
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,201
warm colors, aren't they?

191
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,303
That's right
They're warm.

192
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,905
The light blue and green
are cold colors

193
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,640
That's Tight

194
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,142
They're c Id colors

195
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,711
So it's a battle between warm
colors and cold colors

196
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,847

00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,648

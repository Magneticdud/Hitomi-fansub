CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 41

2
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,625
"Katsuobushi"?
(Dried bonito flakes)

3
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,160
When you're faced with
a challenge...

4
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,662
It has the character
"katsu" (to win)

5
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,764
That's awesome!

6
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,301
See how worried everyone
is about you, Hitomi...

7
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,669
You'll have to do
your best...

8
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,037
I'll do my best.

9
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,772
I'll call whether
I win or lose.

10
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,374
I don't like pretending
to be friends.

11
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,312
Who do you think
you are!

12
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,625
After practicing like crazy
for about two weeks, Hitomi

13
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,928
and the others auditioned
for the promotion video.

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,908
Congratulations,
Mika and Emi!

15
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,678
It's the announcement of
the judges' decision.

16
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:34,219
Laugh or cry... This is
the final winner today...

17
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,260
The winner is from HIPZ!

18
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,474
Entry number nine... Kyoko,
Chisato and Kuriko!

19
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,846
Congratulations!

20
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,384
Is this for real?

21
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,721
Kyoko, Chisato and Kuriko...

22
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,891
They're shaking hands
with KEN right now...

23
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,896
The four groups on this
stage are the winners

24
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,233
of the audition for
background dancers...

25
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,203
Give them all another
round of applause.

26
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,993
It's too bad, isn't it?

27
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,394
These things happen...

28
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,331
Shall we go, and have cake
to cheer us up?

29
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,833
I know a good bakery nearby.

30
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,871
Why, KEN? I don't agree
with your decision.

31
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,943
Tell me why you
didn't pick me?

32
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,216
Your dancing is closed.

33
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,620
What do you mean by that?

34
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,021
I don't understand.

35
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,224
It means your heart is closed.

36
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,126
You need to open up your
heart a little more,

37
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,894
and enjoy your dancing...

38
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,663
Together with
everyone here.

39
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,932
Keep working at it.

40
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,918
Junko...?

41
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,087
Let's go after KEN,
and ask him, too.

42
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,791
We already know why...

43
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,559
It's because
we were lousy.

44
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,375
Hitomi...?

45
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,966
For Hitomi, this was the
first real audition that

46
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,436
she tried for since
she came to Tokyo.

47
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,609
She tried her best in
her own way, and

48
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,179
she thought she had
worked hard at it.

49
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,652
It made her realize again
how harsh the world of

50
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,921
dancing could be.

51
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,222
Katsutaro had told Hitomi
to call when the results

52
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,926
were in, but Hitomi hadn't
been able to do that.

53
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,834
I'm home!

54
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,823
I'm home, Grandpa.

55
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm sorry I didn't call.

56
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,364
Actually, I failed
today's audition...

57
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,133
Never mind that...

58
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,170
Hurry, and help me
prepare dinner...

59
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,305
You and I are making
dinner today.

60
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,679
Hitomi!

61
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,682
Are you finished
eating yet?

62
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,117
Not yet.

63
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,418
That's perfect then...

64
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,921
Someone gave me "tatami iwashi", so

65
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,522
(Note: tatami iwashi are
dried baby sardines entwined
to form a single mat-like sheet)

66
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,924
I brought some for
the children...

67
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,158
It's full of calcium.

68
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,660
Thank you.

69
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,961
You're always
thinking of us.

70
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,396
Say, 'thank you",
all of you.

71
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,997
Thank you, Ume!

72
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,232
You don't have to
thank me...

73
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,900
We're neighbors,
aren't we?

74
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,368
Ume...?

75
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,370
I failed today's
audition...

76
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,239
After all the support
you gave me...

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,841
I'm really sorry.

78
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,776
That's too bad.

79
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,879
You win some,
you lose some...

80
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,216
Like the weather... Sometimes it
rains and sometimes it shines.

81
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,284
That's true.

82
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,686
Sorry to bother you.

83
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,287
Thank you so much.

84
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,522
Thank you.

85
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,457
Shall we grill this
"tatami iwashi"?

86
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,025
Katsu!

87
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,594
What?

88
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,862
Will you do something out
that dad of mine?

89
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,163
Did he do something again?

90
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,432
He has a date with Mari the
day after tomorrow...

91
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,301
He went to the department store,
and bought a 10000 yen

92
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,970
shirt to wear on the date.

93
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,805
That makes me mad...
I sell shirts here!

94
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,274
That's what I told him, and do
you know what he told me...?

95
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,009
That the shirts you sell
here aren't that great.

96
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,611
That Yujiro...!

97
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,948
Yuzo... I failed the
audition today...

98
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,416
You did...?

99
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,085
After you gave us the
"katsuobushi"...

100
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,853
I'm sorry I wasn't
good enough!

101
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,088
Forget about it.

102
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,623
It's just "katsuobushi".

103
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,525
It's just written with the
character "katsu" (to win),

104
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,794
so just eating it, doesn't
mean you'll win.

105
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,563
So will you tell
him for me...?

106
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,365
Tell him not to waste
his money like that.

107
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,133
All right. I'll tell him.

108
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,601
See you all later.

109
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,108
No matter what happens...

110
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,976
We have to eat.

111
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,749
No matter what happens,
we always have a nice,

112
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,984
hot meal here at home.

113
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,321
Let's make this
"tatami iwashi".

114
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,401
When I got home,
I was so happy.

115
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,038
Because I didn't call,
they all knew that

116
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,208
I failed the audition, so
they just acted normal

117
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,344
when I came home.

118
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,183
Grandpa was making dinner,
the children were doing

119
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:52,724
their homework. Ume and
Yuzo just stopped by...

120
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:01,299
No matter what happens,
we can have a hot meal

121
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,738
and no matter what happens,
life will go on like this

122
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:12,877
everyday and it made me
realize that I can do my

123
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,314
best as long as I have a place
like this to come home to.

124
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,216
It cheered me up a little.

125
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,221
I'm sure it's the same
for the children, too.

126
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,957
You have to make a place
like that for them.

127
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,931
Do your best.

128
00:10:52,018 --> 00:11:02,794
"Don't lose... don't give
up... and believe..."

129
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:12,270
"That's what's most
important."

130
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,719
If you don't know the
words, don't sing!

131
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,190
You're in better spirits
than I thought.

132
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,192
Of course I am!

133
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,529
I can't be depressed just because
I failed an audition.

134
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,764
And here I thought
I would comfort you.

135
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,237
Tanaka Moe

136
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,543
Hello? Moe?

137
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,413
I'm at BROCKS right now...

138
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,048
Yuka's in trouble...

139
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,584
Yuka? What kind
of trouble?

140
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,618
It's terrible!

141
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,021
She's in terrible trouble.
Really terrible!

142
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,623
Don't try to snatch
Yuka away.

143
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,026
Who are you? It's none
of your business!

144
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,431
Where are you going?

145
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,133
Hey, Yuka!

146
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,367
Are you okay?

147
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,803
It's terrible! Come over
here right away

148
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,472
Wait! Moe?

149
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,906
Hello! Moe!

150
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,908
What's wrong?

151
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,111
Yuka's in trouble...

152
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,479
I don't know what's
going on, but

153
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,414
someone's trying to
take Yuka away.

154
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,782
She's at a club
in Shibuya...

155
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,016
She wants me to
come right away.

156
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,151
At a club?

157
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,586
I'll come with you.

158
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,854
You'll need help,
wont you?

159
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,966
Wait a minute...
She's okay.

160
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,434
Not you again!

161
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,002
It's none of your
business!

162
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,278
This is the place!

163
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,353
What is it?

164
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,122
I'm nervous!

165
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,093
I've never been to a
place like this.

166
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,728
You don't have anything to
worry about with the way

167
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,429
you're dressed...! Hurry!
Let's go!

168
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,031
Hurry!

169
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Moe!

170
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,268
Hitomi!

171
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,369
I brought help.

172
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,670
Hello.

173
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,738
It'll be a great help.

174
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,972
So what's going on?

175
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,074
Look over there!

176
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,509
Shall we go?

177
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,178
By any chance...
Is Yuka drunk?

178
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,146
Hopelessly drunk...

179
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,282
She's been drinking
by herself all night.

180
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,850
So who are those guys?

181
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,685
They're fighting
over Yuka.

182
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,788
The two guys in the red
and orange tried to

183
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,657
pick Yuka up first.

184
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,259
After that, when Yuka was
dancing by herself, the

185
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,295
two guys in the green and
light blue jackets

186
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,963
tried to pick her up.

187
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,798
In other words, the red
and the orange are

188
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,201
warm colors, aren't they?

189
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,303
That's right...
They're warm.

190
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,905
The light blue and green
are cold colors...

191
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,640
That's right.

192
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,142
They're cold colors.

193
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,711
So it's a battle between warm
colors and cold colors.

194
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,847
I see...

195
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,648
So what about it?

196
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,885
I'm just trying to get it
straight in my head.

197
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,254
I keep telling you over
and over again!

198
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,256
We came up to
her first!

199
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,491
She said she didn't want
you two, and she was

200
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,826
going with us!

201
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,295
Don't make up stories!

202
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,563
That's right.

203
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,998
Stop it!

204
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,334
Yuzo!

205
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,970
Isn't that why
you came?

206
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,842
Stop it!

207
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,113
Haven't you heard of
Yuzo from Tsukiji?

208
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,783
Of course they never
heard of him.

209
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,123
Will he be okay?

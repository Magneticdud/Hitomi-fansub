4
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,743
The Tokyo preliminaries for
Dance Beat were over

5
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,612
Hitomi didn't make it.

6
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,663
What are we going
to do from now on?

7
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,199
ROSE MARY?

8
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,671
I can't continue, you know?

9
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,409
Which means...

10
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,804
Were the judges
really watching?

11
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,174
People on the other teams
were all really good

12
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,943
Hitomi..

13
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,846
School entrance exams
are the same

14
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,983
A passing score is
95 points, isn't it?

15
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,887
If you got a 95 but 
a lot of people scored 96

16
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,956
or higher, you may not get in
since there's only a limited

17
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,259
number of spaces
for each school

18
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,661
That's right..

19
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,598
Good evening

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Mom!

21
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:53,839
Hitomi! I brought
your favorite cake

22
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,275
Thank you!

23
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,312
What a feast!

24
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,552
It's a "Good Job" Party 
for Hitomi.

25
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,288
Would you care to
join us? 

26
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,558
Is it OK?

27
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,126
Yes, it is

28
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,562
I'll go wash my hands

29
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:21,767
Mom?

30
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,301
Did you go out of your way

31
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,904
to buy this and bring
it here?

32
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,039
Thank you

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,340
What are you saying?

34
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,209
How's your ankle?

35
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,811
Sure enough now that it's over,
it's starting to hurt

36
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,549
And how's Hitomi?

37
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,452
She's taking it better
than I expected

38
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,921
I'm so glad.

39
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,227
Ah, rare to see 
you here as customers

40
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,097
We had the day off, so
we thought we'd have a drink.

41
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,499
It's the excitement from
the dance contest

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,668
How about a beer then?

43
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,670
Sounds good

44
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,872
Thank you

45
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,744
How's Hitomi?

46
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,848
She's surprisingly
light hearted

47
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,684
She talked quite a bit
during dinner tonight

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,387
I'm glad to
hear that

49
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,868
Here..

50
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,336
Thanks

51
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,440
How was "Matsuri"?

52
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,444
The "Monjayaki Brothers"
were there.

53
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,548
Since they went to cheer
for you at the dance

54
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,918
contest, they took a day off
from the "monja" shop

55
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,855
Mako and Hiroshi both said
they thought your dancing

56
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,759
was really good.
It was really cool

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,461
They did?

58
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,473
So what will you do now, 
with ROSE MARY?

59
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,479
We broke up.

60
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,654
Junko promised her brother
that she'd take over

61
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,656
their family business

62
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,326
She has to keep
her promise

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,194
That's right.

64
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,670
After we finished dancing,
I really felt great

65
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:44,076
Because I gave it everything
I had, and I felt like

66
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,912
We had all become one

67
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,153
So I have no
regrets at all

68
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,293
There are times when you
score a 95, but you get

69
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,529
beaten by those who
scored a 96

70
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,865
Just like you said

71
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,305
But you know

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,211
Junko has to quit dancing,
and go back to her family

73
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,980
home in Utsunomiya

74
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,322
When I think about that,
I wonder if there wasn't

75
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:37,295
something more I could do,
or maybe

76
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,766
my dancing was lousy,
after all

77
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,902
I'm thinking about

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:55,881
various things.

79
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,550
A few days later

80
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,456
Let's start our lesson...

81
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,762
Several days later, Ray was
giving her final lesson for

82
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,665
her year-long class.

83
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,104
Since her ankle wasn't
completely healed yet

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,740
Hitomi was playing it safe,
and just watching today

85
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,386
Ray's final lesson was
the same as always

86
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,258
As if to say that dancing
was no special path, but like

87
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,729
studying or other work,
culmination of repeating

88
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,834
small things each day.

89
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,189
Actually we have one
more announcement

90
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,691
to make to all of you

91
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,361
This is not just Ray's
final class, but as of

92
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,331
today, she is leaving
this dance school.

93
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,404
While I was teaching this class,
I learned a lot from

94
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:31,610
all of you, so in that
sense, I was also one

95
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,845
of the students. 

96
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,717
I love dancing, so I plan 
to continue dancing.

97
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:44,523
But I want to think about
how I'll continue

98
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,832
Just like all of you who have
finished this lass today,

99
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,334
I want to find my own path.

100
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,738
Thank you.

101
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,574
Let's meet again

102
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,058
I heard... You didn't
make it to the finals

103
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,294
But it's thanks to you
that we got

104
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,129
this far, Rose

105
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,265
Without Rose, there wouldn't
be a ROSE MARY

106
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,901
You don't have to flatter
me like that.

107
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,470
So, we'd like to show you our
appreciation with this

108
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,974
Thank you very much!

109
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,677
Thank you!

110
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,713
Dance is love!

111
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,724
Whether you lost or didn't
isn't a problem

112
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:57,329
The point is making a
flame burn in your soul.

113
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,164
How about it?

114
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,499
Did you give spark
to your life?


115
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,804
Yes, we did!

116
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,881
Are you leaving for Utsunomiya
from here, Junko?

117
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm going to Utsunomiya
from here and talk to

118
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,957
them about the restaurant,
then I'll come back here

119
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,493
and move out of my
apartment.

120
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,597
Then I guess I'll go and live
with my parents.

121
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,533
Living alone is good too...
but paying rent is

122
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,235
a waste of money.

123
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,205
Don't live alone!

124
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,840
Especially when it seems you
and dad are going to

125
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,475
get along better

126
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,248
And next year, maybe Moe will
go out on Dance Beat

127
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,183
Impossible!

128
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,451
Why don't you try?

129
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,220
Impossible, no way!

130
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,333
See you!

131
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,602
Take care!

132
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,638
See you again!

133
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,565
Yuka! Junko! Moe!

134
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,005
Thank you!

135
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,279
^ jijH

136
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,163
I'm home

137
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:45,497
Welcome back

138
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,210
What are you doing?

139
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,112
Customers aren't coming

140
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,847
so I was going to
close up shop.

141
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,449
I'll help you

142
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,917
Thanks

143
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,924
Put that 
away inside

144
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,296
I was talking with
everyone over lunch

145
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,435
Junko's going home to
Utsunomiya, Yuka's

146
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,071
going to live with
her parents

147
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,476
I see.. So everyone's
going to live their

148
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,878
own life

149
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,881
I'll be lonely...

150
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,884
And you?

151
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,789
What are you
going to do?

152
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:57,235
I feel like my
canvas was wiped blank.

153
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,475
So what kind of picture
are you going to paint

154
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,245
on that blank canvas?

155
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,390
It sounds like the
rice is ready.

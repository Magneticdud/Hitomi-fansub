47
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,684
.She talked quite a bit

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,387
I'm gldd to
Miear that

00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,868
ere..

50
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,336
Thanks

51
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,440
How was it at "Matsuri"?

52
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,444
The "Monjayaki Brothers"
were there.

53
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,548
Since they went to cheer
you on at the dance

54
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,918
contest, they closed
the "monja" shop

55
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,855
Mako and Hiroshi both said
they thought your dancing

56
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,759
was really good.
It was really cool

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,461
They did?

58
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,473
So what are you going to
do about ROSE MARY*

59
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,479
We broke up.

60
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,654
Junko promised her brother
that she d take over

61
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,656
their family business

62
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,326
She has to keep
her promise

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,194
That's right

64
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,670
After we finished dancing,
I really felt great

65
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:44,076
Because gave it everything
I had, and I felt like

66
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,912
We had all become one

67
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,153
So I have no
egrets at all

68
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,293
There are times when you
score a 95, but you get

69
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,529
beaten by those who
scored a 96

70
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,865
Just like y li said

71
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,305


72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,211
Junko has to Quit dancing,
and go bade \6 erfamify

73
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,980
home nUts\inomiya

74
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,322
When I think about that,
I wonder if there wasn't

75
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:37,295
something more I could do,
or maybe

76
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,766
My dancing was lousy,
after all

77
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,902
ft just m tie me think

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:55,881



79
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,550
f eV ral da^s l let



80
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,456
Let s start our lesson...

81
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,762
Several days later, RAY was
giving her final lesson for

82
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,665
her year-long class.

83
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,104
Since her ankle wasn't
completely healed yet

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,740
Hitomi was playing it safe,
and just w tching today

85
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,386
RAY's final lesson ^vas
the game as glways

86
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,258
As if to say that dancing
was like going to s ho f

87
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,729
or Working at a job,was
elimination of the little

88
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,834
hmej^you do day by day.

89
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,189
Ac ualiy we have one
m re announcement

90
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,691
to make io alt of you

91
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,361
This is not just RAY s
-final class, but as of

92
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,331
today, she is leaving
this dance ^chool.

93
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,404
As itStight this class,
I learned a lot from

94
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:31,610
all of you, so n that
sense, I was Iso ne

95
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,845
of the students \
Jhiss voT

96
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,717
I love dancing, so I'll
continue d Tiring.

97
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:44,523
But I want to think about
ho r going to continue

98
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,832
Just tike all of you who have
finished this lass today,

99
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,334
I want to find my oWn path.

100
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,738
Thank vou.

101
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,574

Wi limit you, there wouldn't
a ROSE MARY

106
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,901
You don't have to flatter

107
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,470
So>e<Hike to show you our
appreciation with this

108

Thank you very much'

109
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,677
Thank you1

110
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,713
Dance is love1

111
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,724
It's not whether you
won or

losf

112
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:57,329
What's important is w "ether
oti all burned up your soul.

113
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,164
How about it*

114
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,499
Did you give Spark
o your


115
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,804
Yes, we did1

116
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,881

from h Ye, .unko?

117
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm going to Utsunomiva
from h€Fe, and talk|o

118
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,957
them about *he restaurant,
then I'll c me back h4^

119
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,493
and move out of my
^apartment.

120
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,597
Maybe I'll go, and live
with my parents.

121
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,533
I could live alone, but
it would be a waste

122
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,235
to pay rent

123
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,205
That 5 a good idea

124
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,840
Since it seems like your
dad wants to make up

125
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,475
with you, too

126
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,248
And ext year, maybe Moe will
Co out on Dance Beat

127
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,183

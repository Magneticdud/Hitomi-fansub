CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 50

2
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:33,206
Do you mean...

3
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,708
...you're getting married?

4
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,044
I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

5
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,947
Can you come out tonight?

6
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:42,949
I can... I sure can.

7
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:46,086
I'll meet you at ROSE
at about eight.

8
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:49,989
I won't tell Dad...

9
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:51,958
I mean. I won't tell Grandpa.

10
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:54,494
I'll see you later.

11
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:07,373
Good evening!

12
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:08,974
Hitomi...

13
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:10,376
Hitomi!

14
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:12,645
Hello...

15
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:14,513
Have a seat.

16
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:17,916
Come over here...

17
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,284
Come here...

18
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,854
Katsumata Seiji, 28 years old.
Occupation... Web designer.

19
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:24,956
What's that?

20
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,625
How should I know?

21
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,193
Why don't you ask him?

22
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:29,728
They met at the end of last year...

23
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,763
At the hospital where
Keiko works...

24
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,698
He was hospitalized with
acute appendicitis, and

25
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,533
Keiko was the nurse in charge...

26
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,002
I see!

27
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,805
What are you drinking?

28
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,473
I'll have a gin tonic.

29
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,575
Roger!

30
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:50,114
Sorry to interrupt you...

31
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:52,483
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Katsumata.

32
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:54,085
I'm Ippongi Hitomi.

33
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,254
Rose just told me that
you were a patient...?

34
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:58,856
That's right.

35
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:00,724
He was hospitalized for
about two weeks at the

36
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,126
end of last year.

37
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,361
I didn't think that we
would be dating at the

38
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,764
time, but he called me.

39
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,934
I spent Christmas Eve last
year in the hospital, and

40
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:14,805
I had just broken up
with my girlfriend.

41
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:19,676
And she was the one was
with me at the time.

42
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:23,913
It was just part of my job.

43
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,783
After I was released from
the hospital, I couldn't

44
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:28,785
forget about her, and
I thought that maybe

45
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,254
we were destined
for each other...

46
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,592
He seems...

47
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,194
...really nice.

48
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,963
He's really nice!

49
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,632
He sends me about 20 e-mails
everyday, asking me if I'm

50
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,601
okay, and if I'm not too tired.

51
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,303
I just send it without
thinking since I sit

52
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,605
in front of the computer all day long.

53
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,675
You're a web designer, aren't you?

54
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,745
I mainly create home pages
for companies.

55
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,914
He works for a company
in Roppongi.

56
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:02,684
I guess you'd call it
an IT enterprise.

57
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,455
I want to go out on my
own in the future.

58
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,693
You're spilling it all
over the place.

59
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,162
Tuck this in front.

60
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:15,830
In front..?

61
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,565
I'll take it for you.

62
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,633
I'll get you a wet cloth.

63
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,734
No... it's okay.

64
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,269
You want a wet cloth?

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,804
Come and get the
wet cloth, Hitomi.

66
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,705
Come, and get the cloth.

67
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:34,648
What do you think
of that Katsumata?

68
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,023
He seems a little weak...

69
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,893
What do you mean a little?

70
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,563
He's definitely not Katsu's type.

71
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:52,833
Roppongi? IT enterprise?
Web designer?

72
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:57,270
I hate to say this, but
don't you think he sort

73
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,308
of resembles your father,
a man Katsu hates?

74
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:04,110
Maybe a little.

75
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:09,215
I'm positive he can't carry
a portable shrine.

76
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,386
As soon as Katsu sees him,
he might yell, "I won't

77
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:16,522
let a man like that have
my precious Keiko."

78
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,794
Especially after what
happened with Momo.

79
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:24,797
It's possible.

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,536
Meanwhile, Katsutaro was
at "Matsuri" as a favor

81
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,137
to Yujiro.

82
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:34,973
After I drink this. I'll have
my last drink of sake.

83
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,944
Mari...

84
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:40,746
What is it?

85
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:44,883
Actually, it's about Yujiro.

86
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:52,557
Yujiro really regrets what he did...

87
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:56,561
Getting drunk like that, and
holding your hand...

88
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:02,366
But the dating thing...

89
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,336
He never expected to
be shut out after

90
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:09,240
asking you about that, so
he asked me to try and

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,577
subtly ask you about it...

92
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:19,116
But I really don't know how
to be subtle about it.

93
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,419
Is that why you had two
bottles of sake?

94
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,154
That's right. I drank it all.

95
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:26,256
Thanks for being
so considerate.

96
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,827
So how do you really feel?

97
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:36,800
Actually... I was happy
when he said that.

98
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:42,372
You were? Yujiro will be
so happy to hear that.

99
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:45,608
Then why did you tell him
that he shouldn't do

100
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,378
things like that?

101
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,449
I don't know how to explain it, but

102
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,451
I'm a little scared...

103
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:59,188
...of what will happen
if we start something...

104
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:03,058
Considering our age.

105
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:09,598
It seems a little late for
something like that.

106
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,367
It's more than enough for
me to go out once in a

107
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:16,705
while, and for him to
come here to drink.

108
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:19,274
I didn't think it was necessary to go

109
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,409
through the formalities
of dating and things

110
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,311
like that at our age.

111
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:25,814
I see...

112
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,616
Do you understand?

113
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:33,888
I do... I guess if you were
in your thirties or forties...

114
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,491
But we're past that age already.

115
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,859
That's just it.

116
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:41,462
Will you just explain
it to Yu for me?

117
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,965
You want me to tell him?

118
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,233
You're giving me
more homework?

119
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,803
I'II treat you to sake.
Let me heat it for you.

120
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,304
I'll take it.

121
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,406
Here you go.

122
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,345
I went to see Dad today
to tell him that there

123
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,914
was someone I was thinking
of marrying, and that I would

124
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,784
bring him over on Sunday.

125
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,255
But Momoko showed up, and
they got into a fight

126
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,390
about your dad...

127
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,661
And I thought, "Oh no!
Katsumata's the type

128
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,930
that Dad hates."

129
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,904
Actually, it seems strange
that he's your type, Keiko.

130
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,472
That's right.

131
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,408
I thought you liked the
more masculine type.

132
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,143
Maybe it's because
m a nurse? but

133
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,245
I seem to have a weak spot
for guys who need a lot

134
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,914
of attention

135
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,349
And most of all, it's the
first time anyone has

136
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,685
asked me to marry him

137
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,621
So I thought,
Why not?"

138
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,693
What do you think, Hitomi?

139
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,595
Do you think Dad will like him?

140
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,665
I don't know...

141
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,068
I think it's important to
take him by surprise.

142
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:00,405
You know how Katsu is so quick
to start an argument.

143
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,540
What should I do?

144
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,043
You have to judge his mood.

145
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:10,181
How about if the two of you
standby at Mako's place,

146
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,884
and Hitomi will see if he's
in the right mood, then

147
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,018
call you two over?

148
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:15,286
That might be a good idea.

149
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,988
Will you do it, Hitomi?
This coming Sunday.

150
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,090
Got it. We'll wait for
the perfect timing.

151
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,101
Hitomi!

152
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:32,670
Grandpa...

153
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:35,072
How was Mari?

154
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:38,442
I understand how
Mari feels, but

155
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,444
I don't know if Yujiro
will understand the

156
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,045
subtle nuance...

157
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:43,747
You're back...

158
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,081
Were you waiting for me?

159
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:47,617
No, I wasn't, but I couldn't
help wondering what you

160
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:49,386
two talked about...

161
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:50,820
I'll tell you now.

162
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,888
i want to hear, too.

163
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:52,722
You, too?

164
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:53,757
You don't want me to?

165
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,492
It's not that, but I would
have to explain a lot

166
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:58,895
of things... about getting drunk,
and everything else.

167
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:00,897
I already told Hitomi
about that.

168
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:05,401
About you doing this, and
Mari doing this to you.

169
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:06,736
You already told her?

170
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:07,870
He told me.

171
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:11,340
Come on in, Yujiro.

172
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,209
Come on in.

173
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,049
I see... is that it?

174
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:24,253
I'm relieved...

175
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:28,156
That Mari didn't hate
me for what I did.

176
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:33,962
She told me that she really enjoyed
your date to Kamakura.

177
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,898
That's why she wants to
keep things the way

178
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:39,634
they are now.

179
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,638
I think I understand.

180
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,340
You do?

181
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,409
I had a friend in
Sapporo like that.

182
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,345
They loved each other, but
as soon as they started

183
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,647
dating, they broke up.

184
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,153
We haven't verified yet
if Mari loves Yujiro.

185
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:06,360
We don't know yet, but
Mari says that they're

186
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,531
past the age to be
talking about love.

187
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,769
But, I think she does
love him... otherwise,

188
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:18,839
she wouldn't have gone
to Kamakura with him.

189
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,476
I agree.., She does,
doesn't she? Thanks.

190
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,947
I think it's important
that you put a lid

191
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:33,620
on those feeling of love
and things like that,

192
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,425
and just go on seeing her as
a customer at her place.

193
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,462
You have to draw the line.

194
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,667
I'll put a lid on my
feelings, and just

195
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,736
go on seeing her as one
of her customers.

196
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,205
Do that.

197
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:54,874
I will.

198
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:00,579
A woman's heart is really
complicated, isn't it?

199
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,414
It's hard being a man.

200
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,550
It's so hard that I'm
going to sleep.

201
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:07,853
Good night.

202
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,448
Yuka's really getting
into it, isn't she?

203
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,683
She's finally made
up her mind to

204
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:41,285
live away from her parents.

205
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,656
What is she going to
do about money?

206
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,258
She's going to work part-time
at the pub where I work.

207
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:52,196
Where is she going to live?

208
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,767
At my apartment... We're
going to be roommates.

209
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:00,170
It's really unexpected
that you two would

210
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,771
agree to share and apartment.

211
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:02,873
It really is.

212
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:04,007
I thought so, too.

213
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,544
But it'll cut my rent in half
so I decided to do it.

214
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,213
The problem is moving out.

215
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,549
I'm not going to use
my parents money.

216
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,584
I won't use their
credit card either.

217
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,886
And of course, I won't
use their car.

218
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:20,623
So I want you all to help me
move all my things over.

219
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,526
I don't think I'll have
that much stuff.

220
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:26,262
Okay...

221
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:39,308
Yuka's house really is
awesome, isn't it?

222
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,611
She really is a rich
girl, isn't she?

223
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,515
It's opening...

224
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,823
What are those bags?

225
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,658
Are we supposed to
carry all of that?

226
00:13:58,593 --> 00:13:59,861
Thanks for waiting.

227
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,930
These are my things.

228
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,097
Help me.

229
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,132
Hurry!

230
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,200
Help me!

231
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,106
Take this.

232
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:14,275
You take this one, Moe.

233
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,243
Here, Junko.

234
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,778
You want me to carry this?

235
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,281
This is all of it.

236
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,715
Let's get going.

237
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:22,783
Yuka!

238
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,618
Say farewell to being
a little rich girl.

239
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,519
I don't want to!

240
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,854
Say it!

241
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,161
Farewell, little rich girl!

242
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:37,464
Let's race!

243
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,101
Wait!

244
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:42,469
Wait for me.

245
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,908
Hitomi and the others are
running so that Yuka can

246
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,810
start a new life.

247
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,812
Continue...

How should I know?

21
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,680
Why don't you ask him?

22
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,249
They met at the end
of ast /ear.

23
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,251
At the hospital where
Keiko works..

24
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,219
He was hospitalized with
acute appendicitis, and

25
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,054
Keiko was the nurse
in charge

26
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,490
Katsumata Seiji

27
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,326
What are you drinking?

28
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,995
II have a gin tonic

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,063
Roger!

30
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,636
Sorry to interrupt you

31
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,005
Pleased to meet you.
m Katsumata

32
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,606
m Ippongi Hitomi.

33
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,743
Rose ju 1 told me that
you were a patient...?

34
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,378
That's right

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,246
He was hospit liz d for
about two weeks at the

36
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,648
end of ast year

37
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,850
didn'fthink tha we
would be dating at the

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,252
time, but he called me

39
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,423
I spent Christmas Eve last
year in the hospital, and

40
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,327
I had just broken up
with Yny girlfriend

41
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:20,199
And she was the one was
with me at the time

42
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,436
It was just part
of my job

43
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,306
After I was released from
the h ^pital, i couldn't

44
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,308
forget bout her ;and
I thought that maybe

45
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,743
we were (Jestmed
for each other...

46
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,082
He seems...

47
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,684
really nice

48
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,486
He's really nice!

49
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,122
e on s me about 20 e-mails
everyday, asking me if I'm

50
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,091
okay, and if I'm not
too tired

51
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,793
I just send it without
thinking since 1 si

52
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,095
in front of the computer
all day long.

53
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,198
You're a web designer,
aren't you?

54
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,269
I mainly create home pages
for companies

55
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,404
He works for a company
in Roppongi

56
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,208
I guess you'd call it
an IT enterprise

57
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,946
want to go out on my
own in the future

58
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,184
Youy filing it all
over .ie ace

59
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,653
Tuck this in front

60
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,321
in front. ?

61
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,056
I'll take it for you

62
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,157
I'll get you
a wet ciotti

63
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,259
No... it's okay

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,760
You want a wet cloth?

65
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,295
Come and get the
wet cloth, Hitomi

66
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,197
Come, and get the cloth

67
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,140
Whkt do you think
of that Katsumata?

68
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,548
He seems a little weak

69
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,385
What do you mean a little?

70
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,088
He's definitely not
Katsu s type

71
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,325
Roppongi? IT enterprise?
Web designer?

72
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,763
I hate to say this, but
don*! you think he sort

73
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,801
of resembles your father,
a ma Katsu hates?

74
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,603
Maybe a little

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,708
I'm positive he can't carry
a portable shrine.

76
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,879
As soon as Katsu sees him,
he might yell, "I won't

77
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,015
let a man like that have
my precious Keiko"

78
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,287
Especially after what
happened with Momo.

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,290
It's possible

80
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,029
Meanwhile. Katsutaro was
at" atsuri" as a favor

81
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,631
to Yulro

82
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,467
After I drin.Ihis. I'll have
my last drink of sake

83
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,438
Mari.

84
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,239
Whatjs it?

85
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,377
Actually it's tout Yujiro

Consideringt)ur age.

105
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:10,095
It seeifis aiittle late for
something like that

106
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,864
It's more than enou ~h for
me to go outance in a

Will you just explain
-itJoYiiior me?

117
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,463
You want me to
tell him?

118
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,731
You're giving me
more homework?

119
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,301
JII treat / \i to sake.
Let me heat it for you.

120
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,802
HI take it.

121
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,904
Here you go

122
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,844
went to see Dad today
to tell him thai there

123
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,413
was someone i was thinking
of marrying, and that i would

124
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,282
bring him over on Sunday

125
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,753
But Mdmoko showed up, and
they got into a fight

126
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,889
about your dad

127
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,160
And I thought, "Oh no*
Katsumata s the type

128
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,429
that Dad hates '

129
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,403
Actually, it seems strange
that he s your type, Keiko.

130
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:26,972
That's right

131
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,908
thought you liked the
more masculine type

132
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,643
Maybe it's because
m a nurse? but

133
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,745
I seem to have a weak spot
for guys who need a lot

134
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,413
of attention

135
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,849
nd most of all, it's the
irst time anyone has

136
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,185
asked me to marry him

137
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,121
So I thought,
Why not?"

138
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,193
What do you think, Hitomi?

139
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,095
Do you think Dad
will like hTJi?

140
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,165
I don't know

141
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,569
I think it's impbrtant to
take him by surprise

142
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,906
You know how Katsu is so quick
to start an argument

143
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,041
ihat should I do?

144
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,544
You have to judge
his mood

145
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,682
How about if the two of you
standby at Mako s place,

146
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,385
and Hitomi will see if he s
in the \ighi mood, then

147
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,519
cailjou two over?

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,787
hat might be
a good idea

149
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,489
Will you do it, Hitomi?
This coming Sunday

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,591
Got it. We'll wait for
the perfect timing.

151
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,603
Hitomi*

152
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,171
Grandpa..

153
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,574
How was Man?

154
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,944
understand how
Man feels, but

155
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,946
I don't know if Yujiro
will understand the

156
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,547
subtle nuance.

157
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,249
You're back

158
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,584
Were you waiting for me?

159
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,119
No, I wasn't, but I couldn't
help wondering what you

160
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,888
two *alked about.

161

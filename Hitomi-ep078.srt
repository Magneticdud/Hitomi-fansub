CHAPTER 13
The Birth of ROSE MARY
Episode 78

2
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,239
It's the day of the Summer Contest

3
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,912
It's rosemary perfume
and aroma oil

4
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,382
It's a present from
me and Mari

5
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm happy...
Thank you!

6
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,053
You worked really hard,
so just relax.

7
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,290
We are rooting for you
so you'll do fine

8
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,892
You'll do fine!
Just fine!

9
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,864
What time does it start?

10
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,832
2 o clock

11
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,800
Shota and the others
will come, too.

12
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,302
I see, 2 o'clock

13
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,370
If only I could have been
released from the hospital

14
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,206
one week earlier

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,444
So, how are you feeling about it?

16
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,814
Hmm, hard to say...

17
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,187
When you carry the portable

18
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,823
shrine, if you're in harmony, 

19
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,825
it rises so easily.

20
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,795
What makes harmony is

21
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,764
that each person carrying

22
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,568
the shrine trusts
each other,

23
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,905
has complete trust
in each other

24
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,840
If there's just one person
you can't trust, then no

25
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:26,678
matter how hard you try,
the shrine won't go up.

26
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,250
Even if a guy is weak
and small, as long as he

27
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,154
shows that he has the
spirit, you feel that

28
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,091
and it gives you the
spirit to do it, too.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,794
That's how everyone feels
so when it comes time

30
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,164
to lift the shrine, that
feeling flows inside you

31
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,332
and the shrine goes
up smoothly.

32
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:47,966
and the shrine goes
up smoothly

33
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,768
No matter how many times
I experience that

34
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,104
it's still something
I can't explain

35
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:57,242
Just make sure you trust
each other, and make

36
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,811
sure everyone trusts you

37
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,414
That's what it means to
carry a portable shrine.

38
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,715
That's what it means to
carry a portable shrine.

39
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,787
Do your best!

40
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,626
Finally, the contest is
about to begin!

41
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,327
*

42
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,940
Good morning

43
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,908
Hitomi

44
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,877
Good morning

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,314
Will you listen
for a minute?

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,717
I've got it down perfect!

47
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,954
You can say it, but are you
really sure?

48
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,657
I'm really, really,
really sure

49
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,061
Is this the place?

50
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,629
It's chic, isn't it?

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,064
Do you come here
often, Yuzo?

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,632
Of course
I'm a city boy

53
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,234
Everybody!

54
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,969
Hitomi

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,270
You came?

56
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,172
Look at this, Hitomi!

57
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,478
ROSE MARY

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,880

59
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,617
Monja is King!

60

ROSE MARY

61
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,024
Go for it!

62
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,492
We're going to win it!

63
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,997
Story and Dance are summer
special attractions

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:29,835
The 2007 Summer Dance Contest,

71
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,209
Hop...

72
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,578

Next we have entry

82
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:35,227

Give them a hand.

85
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,940
Wow, my heart is pounding so fast!

86
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,976
Why am I so jittery?

87
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,144
Because you're determined..

88
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,980
That's why you're jittery 

89
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,483
Hitomi! Are you sure you've
got it down pat?

90
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm sure. I practiced
this morning, too

91
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:42,888
Trust me.

92
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,623
On what basis do we
trust in Hitomi?

93
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,124
She's single-minded (Ippongi)!

94
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,959
Then, what on basis do we
trust in Junko?

95
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,628
Her determination to
rise up in the world.

96
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,263
Then on what basis do we
trust in Yuka?

97
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,797
I hate to admit it,
but she's excellent!

98
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,699
Then on what basis do we
trust in Moe?

99
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,135
Her ability to soothe
your soul..

100
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,804
On what basis do we
trust in us?

101
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,675
We're all different
but we're together

102
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,013
It's really fate,
isn't it?

103
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,081
Isn't it?

104
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,386
What's that?

105
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,221
Rosemary fragrance

106
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,427
I feel like we can do it!

107
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,862
We can!

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,965

116
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,602
The audience really
got into it, too!

117
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,737
Really?

118
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,006
Hitomi...really
did have it down pat!

119
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,075
You did it, Hitomi!

120
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,744
You always surprise me!

121
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,979
Thank you.

122
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,586
This unit is the best!

123
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,523
I want to go on forever
together like this.

124
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,580

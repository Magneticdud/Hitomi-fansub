00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,744


36
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:04,349
raised Shota as if he

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,591
I thinks know Sh ta better

00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,632
He really lovels "natto'

I'll do the same... If he
lies, I II scold him.

49
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,619

82
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,690
I want Akira and Yuria to

88
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,163
Shota will be ivmg

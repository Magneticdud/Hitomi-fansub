Shota will be living with his
mother Saito Mikie now

11
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,222
All right. Thank you
for letting us know

12
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,394
Several days later.

13
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,233
Yes?

14
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,701
They're here

15
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,203
Come in.

16
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,008
I'm Mikie's father...
Mizushima Toshio

17
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,513
I'm Ippongi Katsutaro.
Pleased to meet you

18
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,815
This is Hitomi.

19
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,184
She's helping Katsutaro
to raise Shota..

20
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,054
I've heard about you
from my daughter.

21
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,622
Thank you so much
for your help

22
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,126
Please, have a seat

23
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,096
If you don't mind, we'll
sit in while you talk.

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,615
Excuse the way I'm dressed...
Like someone in a cowboy

25
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,316
western drama

26
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,118
Not at all

27
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,988
I was going to dress in
something more normal,

28
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,025
but I thought you should
see me as I usually am

29
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,428
I feel the same way.

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,699
You've raised Shota n il
now with such I Ihng care,

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,069
but we'll be raising
him from here on.

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,072
So I wanted you to
see me as I am.

33
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,141
Mr Mizushima?

34
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:56,942
Yes?

35
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,744

36
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:04,349
I raised Shota as if he
were my real son

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,591
I think I know Shota better
than anyone in this world

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,027
I'm sure you do

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,632
He really loves "natto'
(fermented soybeans).

40
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,603
We eat "natto'
every morning.

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,373
He doesn't like
bell peppers

42
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,313
But Hitomi Jrie er r§ 1
bell peppers rateg Vi

43
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,750
him, and he started eating
bell peppers now

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,724
If you slice the peppers
really thin, he'll eat it.

45
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,102
And, I've told him tie er

46
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,807
anything else, but he
mustn't lie.

47
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,676

48
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,614
I'll do the same... If he
lies, I'll scold him.

49
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,619
There are a lot of things
I probably overlooked,

50
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,454
so I don't know o
well I've one

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,190
No... You've raised
him well.

52
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,394
I could tell when I met
him the other day.

53
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,175
This is a shirt that
I sell at my store..

54
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:43,582
I asked 5hota if you
had a big stomach like me

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,585
^arid lie .said you iOnf o
I thought this g oo
 
56
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,153
good on you

57
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,156
Thank you... I'll wear it.

58
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,559
I almost forgot...

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,733
This is dried flying fish
that we make ourselves.

60
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,870
I don't know if you'll
like it or not...

61
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,539
It's one of my
favorite foods

62
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,476
It's a fish!

63
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,379
Of course! He said
it was a flying fish.


64
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,947
That's right.

65
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,350
Thank you

66
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,159
Katsutaro.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,393
Hitomi...

68
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,498
Thank you so much for all
you've done up til now...

69
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,904
You've cared for Shota in
place of Mikie and myself

70
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,272
You've cared for Shota in
place of Mikie and myself

71
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:47,813
We'll take over from here
and raise him.

72
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:55,020
We'll raise him to be someone
you can be proud of.

73
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,656
Please watch over us.

74
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:11,737
Please take care 
of Shota

75
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,375
Thank you

76
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,499
Shota's grandpa was a
nice man, wasn't he?

77
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,667
I'm relieved

78
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,241
What shall we do? We have
one more month.

79
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,077
What do you mean?

80
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,449
I wanted to leave Shota
witn the best memories

81
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,818
before we send him off

82
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,690
I want Akira and Yuria to
spend a lot of time with

83
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,895
Shota during this last month,
so they'll have lots of

84
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,930
memories of Shota.

85
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,503
What shall we do?

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,822
I have something to say

87
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,660
You probably already
know this, but...

88
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,163
Shota will be living
with his mother

89
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,773
He'll be living in
Izu Oshima where

90
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,676
his mother's father, in
other words, Shota's

91
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,313
grandfather lives

92
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:10,989
Hitomi and I went to meet
his grandfather today..

93
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,228
His name is Toshio, and
he's a really nice man

94
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:21,633
So I think he'll give
Shota lots of love

95
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:28,039
Shota will be moving it

I want to hear your ideas
about what we should do

102
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,948
What do you
want to do?

103
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,651
What about going to
the amusement park?

104
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,753
Or shall we take a
trip somewhere?

105
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,588
That's a good idea
Let's go to Hawaii!

106
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,523
We can't go to Hawaii
over the weekend

107
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,792
If we're going, we have to
go somewhere closer

108
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,029
Then how about going
to the hot springs?

109
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,997
We can try out the
different hot springs

110
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,532
and eat lots of
good food.

111
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,901
lA?e don't have to

112
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,137
You don't have
to hold back

113
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,105
Let's go wherever
you want to go

115

Shota.. Are you sure?

116
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,084
Do you just want to do 
what we always do?

117
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,857
I see... You're right

118
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:59,731

OK... we'll honor
Shota's wish

123
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,154
We won't do anything
special, and do

124
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,156
what we always do

125
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,660
We'll treasure each day,
and treasure this

with Shota

127
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,333
That's all I have to say.

128
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,638
Shall we play cards?

129
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,306
Let's play Sevens

130
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,441
Okay

131
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,676
Let's go upstairs.

132
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,986
He's right.. We don't
have to do anything

133
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,855
special, do we?

134
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,027
Shall we put the
laundry away?

135
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,830
Sounds good to me.

136
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,501
Like we always do...

137
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,236

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,187
Don't scare me
like that.

17
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,124
I had a strange dream

18
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,997
The service for the first
anniversary of Setsuko's

19
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,665
death was over.

20
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,601
On this day, the Ippongi
family was filled with

21
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,436
nervous anticipation.

22
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,540
It was the day of the
announcement of

23
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,475
the results of
Akira's entrance exam.

24
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,846
What's wrong, Akira?
Aren't you going to eat?

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,750
Does your stomach hurt?

26
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,754
I was wondering
what would Jia W ?

27
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,189
I don't 3 in.

28
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,360
But you said you did
well on the exam.

29
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,131
I thought I did well, but
what if there were others

30
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,700
who did much better?

31
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,705
But the results are out
already aren't they?

32
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,943
So even if you ^off about
if now, the results won't

33
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,678
change, will they?

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,713
That's true, but...

35
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,482
Worrying won't do any good,
So don't you think it's

36
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,385
better to stop worrying
and just enjoy

37
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,920
your breakfast?

38
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,627
JlliesI

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,766
It's delicious

40
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,269
Isn't it?

41
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,876
It was really busy again
today, wasn't it?

42
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,612
We finally have a
chance to rest.

43
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,248
ito i really
something drastic

44
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,350
h 1 was a old mo e

45
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,186
I think she should
reconsider

46
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,822
What are you
talking about?

47
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,322
What are you
talking about?

48
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,658
You're getting married,
aren't you?

49
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,425
You're getting married,
aren't you?

50
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,360
Who's getting married?

51
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,327
Who's getting married?

52
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,528
You are

53
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,564
Me? Who am I marrying?

54
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,898


55
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,367
No, I'm not

56
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,935
I wouldn't
do that

57
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,271
But he was saying
before you came

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,673
Isn t my bride here yet?

59
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,910
He your darling

60
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,912
He's not my darling!

61
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,849
What are you telling
them anyway?

62
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,418
JDontgt ethatl

63
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,919Y
You've been telling
everyone that you

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,554
and I are getting married,
haven't you?

65
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,390
No, I didn't

66
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,058
I said it was a dream

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,193
It was a dream ..

68
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,131
Even if it was a dream,
it's very annoying.

69
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,966
Don't ever dream
about that again

70
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,802
I can't help it!

71
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,804
You came out...wearing
a wedding gown.

72
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,439
A wedding gown?

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,474
And the two of us
were doing this .

74
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,610
That's right

75
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,445
It's Vrfel/frrith just
the two of us, but.

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,514
That's a strange dream.

77
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,784
So you two aren't
getting married

78
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,719
Putting that aside...

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,421
In the end, you didn't
marry Hitomi

80
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,956
A guy showed up and
took you away

81
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,425


82
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,226


83
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,594
Ken?

84
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,232
That dream is full
of holes..

85
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,969
First of all, Ken and I are
not getting married...

86
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,172
We're not even dating!

87
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:46,111
And even if by some miracle
that should happen..

88
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,613
You have no reason
to complain.

89
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,151
I don't like that guy

90
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,686
\Nhp

91
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,089
He's using his talent
to hit on you.

92
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,558
He's not hitting on me

93
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,493
And besides, the other
day, I'm the one who

94
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,994
wanted to talk to him

95
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,396
What about?

96
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,298
I wanted to tell him
to enter Dance Beat.

97
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,467
Then why doesn't he?
He's a dancer, isn't he?

98
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,635
He is, but he isn't


99
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,539
He had a good friend he

00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,143

101
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,713
I see! I see it all
clearly now.

102
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,082
No matter what you say,
you like the guy.

103

104
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,890
Acting President...

105
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,025
Why did you take so many
orders again, and all of

106
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,694
them small orders, too?

107
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,630
Don't keep doing the same
thing over and over again

108
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,198
Get off my back!

109
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,500
We're in the service
industry so what's

110
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,901
wrong with taking orders
from our customers?

111
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,603
But you did the same
thing the last time

112
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,839
What's wrongf

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,641
What's going on?

114
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,084
Hitomi... Telephone!

115
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,990

Congratulations

Where's your grandpa?

121
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,272
He just called him.
He was really happy.

I'm really grateful

136

When I start high school,
I'll try harder in

137

Let's drink a toast!

Congratulations, Akira!

Cheers!

144
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,809
It's a present for Akira
for passing his exam

145
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,344
Thank you

146
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,213
Akira will be so happy

147
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,216
I'm so glad for Akira

148
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,085
He really worked hard

149
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,421
Here this is
on the house

150
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,356
Thank you

151
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,666
So, how is it going
with you?

152
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,902
How is what going?

153
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,371
Your guy... Mr. Suzuki...

154
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,675
Who?

155
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,943


156
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,379
That's right..
His name is Suzuki.

157
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,815
It really is a 
misunderstanding.

158
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,117
There's nothing
between us

159
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,686
That's just for
now, isn't it?

160
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,020
Even in the future

161
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,989
That's because you
think that way

162
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,225
You never know how love
dsvJestineclio turn put

163
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,228
Why does it matter
so much to you?

164
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,632
I'm worried about you

165
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,702
You're past 20, and you
don't have a boyfriend

166
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,605
You should have seen
me when I was 1..

167
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,474
I was so popular then we
had co-ed mi fers

168
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,710
I had trouble keeping
up with them

169
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,311
Times have changed.

170
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,847
There are a lot of girls who
have boyfriends

171
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,150
epon'tfee!*h 1
o e is ever ing

172
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,519
We're different from
girls in the past

173
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,155
If s how you ...

174
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,024
But if you do fall in
love, make sure you

175
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,426
don't have any regrets

176
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,795
You can hide it from
others, but don't

177
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,198
hide your feelings
from yourself

178
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,452
It's true that I want Ken
to dance again

179
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,922
Dance is all he has

180
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,828
the three of us.

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,500
Hitomi?

182
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,469
Were you thinking
about something?

183
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,838
Could it be love7

184
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,740
No. it's not.

185
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,709
flils, iSII me...

186
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,310


187
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,515
Thank you... But I'm fine.
Don't worry. 

188
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,153
Yuria! Let's play cards
since I passed my exam.

189
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,156
It's no fun playing
with just two of us.

190
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,957
Will you play, Hitomi?

191
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,093
Sorry... I'll pass.

192
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,263
It can't be helped... I guess
I'll play with you, 

193
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,534
What you need when it comes
to love is courage

194
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:58,783
I can't forget!

195
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:03,788
I can't forget
I love him

196
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,192
Stop it! You re disturbing
the neighbors

197
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,476


198
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,829
Stop it! Stop

199
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,566

201
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:50,869
March 2008

202
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,877
Hitomi was giving
it all she had

203
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:15,927
It's hot

204
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,100
What happened, Hitomi?

205
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,701
You're full of
energy today

206
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,870
you're inspiring
me, too

207
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,938
You're ing go fi.

208
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,706
We only have lw weeks

209
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,542
That's our leader!

210
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,179
Yuka. We have to
get to work.

211
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,115
Shall we call
it a day?

212
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,821
We're leaving

213
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,889
See you later!

214
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,964
She's toned down,
hasn't she?

215
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,666
You mean Yuka?

216
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,502
She's a little rich
girl, isn't she?

217
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,638
She used to wear more
expensive things before

218
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,608
She's having a hard time
because of her father

219
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,643
Is that right?

220
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,212
Junko's having a
hard time, too

221
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,114
Her family runs a gyoza
restaurant in Utsunomiya

222
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,051
and she's being pressured
to take over the business

223
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:13,585
and she's being pressured
to take over the business

224
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,987
It sounds like everyone's
having a hard time,

225
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,757
doesn't it? But it'll help
them to dance better

226
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,260
Each carrying her
own burden...

227
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,995
That's how we feel.

228
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,597
Because dance is life

229
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,565
What a good thing to say.

230
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,002
Dance is life, love, spark.

231
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,039
Hitomi!

232
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,309
I thought you went to
your part-time job

233
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,844
We met up with BLUE SHOES!

234
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,290
BLUE SHOES from Osaka
had come to them

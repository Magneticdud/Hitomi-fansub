CHAPTER 10
"Trying too hard to find happiness"
Episode 55

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,093
Does that mean...

3
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,394
...you're getting married?

4
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,697
Please allow me to marry Keiko.

5
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,305
To Keiko, marriage means a family.

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,677
Can you give her the warmth of a family?

7
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,379
Yes... I will.

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,554
This time it's a business trip.

9
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,022
To Atami.

10
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,224
Atami?

11
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,406
It's Mr. Katsumata.

12
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,810
What a coincidence!

13
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,117
itomi saw Mr. atsuma a
together with a om n

14
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,520
other th&h Keiko

15
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,540
I bought tea

16
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,375
Here you go

17
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,543
Thanks

18
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,577
Were you putting on
make-up again?

19
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,346
Hitomi?

20
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,549
Thank you.

21
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,084
What's wr tig? Y u've been
kind of q let

22
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,590
What?

23
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,394
Just as an example..

24
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,798
For example, if you saw a
man and woman walking

25
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,701
down the "SllWay at an inn
wearing cotton kimono,

26
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,903
what wo "Id y to think their
relationship was?

27
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,972
I'd thinkthey were
lovers, of course.

28
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,674
Or a married couple

29
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,510
If they 're not a
married couple

30
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,345
Parent ahd child

31
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,214
Mnp to show gratitude
to a Vent

32
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,381
1

33
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,953
^■what jf they were walking

what jf the re dy
hadjs fia ?

37
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,801
Then

38
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,970
It's an illicit affair!

39
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,571
He betrayed his fiancee
afid went on a trip with

40
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,573
another woman!

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,714
Is it someone $ou know?

42
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,682
What?

43
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,751
) was just giving
an example

44
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,486
That's all

00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,122
We're leaving
Get in the car.

46
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:39,344
Hitomi felt her feet dragging as
she returned to Tsukishima

47
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,815
She didn't know if she
should tell Katsutaro

48
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,818
about what she saw in Atami

49
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,873

You went there to
dance, didn't you?

59

I'm so happy

133
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,464
After tjoing to an
orphanage to live

134
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,600
away from her parents,
she came to live

135
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,835
with you -and Setsuko

136
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,439
She's okay now, but when
she<first came to live

137
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,775
with us, it was
•really rough.

138
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,979
"he had a rebellious
streak that was

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,715
stronger -than most people

140
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,284
If I scolded her for
anything, she would

141
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,787
tear all the paper off
our "Tioji" doors

142
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,056
* And she'd turn over all
the planters in the

143
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,559
whole iieighborhood

144
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,894

Keiko's finally

159
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,148
But you sure do
cry easily.

160
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,587
Did you tell anyone
about it yet?

161
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,389
No, 1 haven't.

162
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,926
Whatever you do
don't tell Yuzo

163
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,696
That fool is very
fond of Keiko,

164
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,165
so you don't want him
to go crazy, do you?

165
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,666
1

166
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,135
What should do?

167
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,237
Should I teil Grandpa?

168
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:46,905
1

169
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,810
Or should go directly
to Keiko, and tell her?

170
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,410
1

171
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,613
Or maybe I shouldn't
teil anybody about it

172
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,149
! have a feeling it'll
all blow over if

173
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,685
I just don't say
anything about it

174
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,222
And! won't be destroying
everybody's happiness.

175
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,826
(don't know
what to do

176
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,131
Not saying an/thing is
one way 7 handling it.

177
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,137
This is an adult's way
of thinking, but

178
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:24,209
They're not married yet, so
we could jclose our eyes

179
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,545
to a little affair and
not make waves.

180
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:33,318
But would Keiko be happy
mam Mo a man like that?

181
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,857
That's right... She won't.
She won't be happy at all

182
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,860
But it's between
the two of them

183
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,361
So I thin < it's best
if they res 1ve this

184
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,963
between themselves

185
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,332
The b ay idbe
if Keiko was suspicious

186
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,200
about 1 s usinesS trip
or just some woman's

187
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,669
intuitio t would make
Keiko realize wt Hf was

188
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,806
going
dif lie would
talk to him ab tJF it

189
00:12:54,807 --> 00:13:00,712
Andifsh a ts tcrfofrgive him,
that would be okay

190
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,348
You know w at they say about
overcotn!ngV)b tacies

191
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,716
making a person stronger

192
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,120
Hitomi

193
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,191
Let's just wait and see
what happens for now

194
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,161
If it t Tkes too long for
Keiko to* e lize W's

195
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,997
going on, on 'bu
can talk to her.

196
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,035
All right. I'll do that

197
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,272
Thank you

198
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,240
YouVfe welcome

199
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,143
Go ahead, and drink

200
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,691
I'm home

201
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,197
I was so happy.

202
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,667
1 linted Dad to i
s iiis blessing^

203
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,038
Aren' you glad
he approved?

204
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,081
Will Keiko be okay?

205
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,087
Just as Rose said, Hitorhi
was just going to walfch,

206
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,723
and see what happens, but
she couldn't help but

207
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,524
worry about Keiko.

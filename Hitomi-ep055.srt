CHAPTER 10
Trying too hard to find happiness
Episode 55

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,093
Does that mean...

3
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,394
...you're getting married?

4
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,697
Please allow me to marry Keiko.

5
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,305
To Keiko, marriage
means a family.

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,677
Can you give her the warmth of a family?

7
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,379
Yes... I will.

8
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,554
This time it's a business trip.

9
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,022
To Atami.

10
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,224
Atami?

11
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,406
It's Mr. Katsumata.

12
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,810
What a coincidence!

13
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,117
Hitomi saw Mr. Katsumata
together with a woman

14
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,520
other than Keiko.

15
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,540
I bought tea.

16
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,375
Here you go.

17
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,543
Thanks.

18
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,100
Were you putting on
make-up again?

19
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,346
Hitomi?

20
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,549
Oh, thank you.

21
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,084
What's wrong?
You've been kind of quiet.

22
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,590
What?

23
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,394
Just for example...

24
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,798
For example, if you saw
a man and woman walking

25
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,701
down the hallway at an inn,
wearing cotton kimonos,

26
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,903
what would you think
their relationship was?

27
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,972
I'd think they were lovers, of course.

28
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,674
Or a married couple...

29
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,510
If they're not a married couple?

30
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,345
Parent and child, on a trip

31
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,214
to show gratitude to a parent.

32
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,381
But...

33
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,953
... what if they were walking
arm-in-arm, like this?

34
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,854
Then they would have to be lovers!

35
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,458
But, what if that man

36
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:52,064
already has a fiancee?

37
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,801
Then

38
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,970
It's an illicit affair!

39
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,571
He betrayed his fiancee and went on a trip with

40
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,573
another woman!

41
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,714
Is it someone you know?

42
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,682
What?

43
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,751
I was just giving an example

44
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,486
That's all

45
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,122
We're leaving. Get in the car.

46
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:39,344
Hitomi's feet dragged as she returned to Tsukishima

47
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,815
She didn't know if she should tell Katsutaro

48
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,818
about what she saw in Atami

49
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,873
I'm home!

50
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,845
You're just in time for dinner, Hitomi!

51
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,282
With everybody's help, we have some really

52
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,017
Awesome tasting curry

53
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,688
This is for you, Hitomi

54
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,456
Thank you!

55
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,594
I'm hungry!

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,630
Okay, let's eat

57
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,168
Hitomi! How was Atami?

58
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,372
You went there for a dance job, didn't you?

59
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,976
It was fun! Our dancing didn't go over too well,

60
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,812
but we got to enjoy the hot springs

61
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,549
Hurry, Hitomi!

62
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,250
I'm sorry

63
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,487
It looks delicious!

64
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,223
We made salad dressing, too

65
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,758
Try the salad

66
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,726
I will!

67
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,194
Let's eat

68
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,935
This is great.

69
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,071
It's delicious

70
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,808
Of course. They worked hard to make it

71
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,877
Try the salad, too

72
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,714
Nice flavor!

73
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,451
Hitomi was afraid that she would blurt it out

74
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,122
What would Katsutaro and Keiko think

75
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,357
if they found out?

76
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,967
Keiko called today

77
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,705
What did she want?

78
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,041
She was complaining that they were both too busy

79
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,377
so they didn't have time to see each other

80
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,814
Mr. Katsumata went on a business trip. He's

81
00:06:55,815 --> 00:07:00,519
working on a company's home... whatever you call it...

82
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,820
in the Kansai area

83
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,455
Home page?

84
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,323
That's it, Home page.

85
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,062
Shota and Yuria made something nice

86
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,546
This is great

87
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,848
It's really nice

88
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,485
The children are really happy

89
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,555
that Keiko's getting married

90
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,959
and will have a family of her own.

91
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,164
They all know how happy she is

92
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,904
What's wrong?

93
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,574
What's up? What were you thinking?

94
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,442
Oh, nothing!

95
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,444
What do you mean, nothing?

96
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,812
Ah, is it OK if I go to Rose's for

97
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,913
a drink? I got paid today - I'll just have one.

98
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,114
Sure, it's OK

99
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,584
I'm going to get my wallet

100
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,321
Are you home, Katsu?

101
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,355
I'm here!

102
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,091
Do you want to go to "Matsuri"?

103
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,327
Mari was getting ready to open up earlier,

104
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,462
and she told me to come over tonight

105
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,599
Did that uncomfortable feeling between the

106
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,167
two of you go away?

107
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,337
I suppressed my worldly desires

108
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,340
Did you suppress them completely?

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,774
I did my best

110
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,276
Good evening

111
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,044
Heading out somewhere?

112
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,779
I'm going to Rose's place

113
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,048
Will you take Yuzo with you?

114
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,150
Since he found out Keiko's getting

115
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,286
married, he's been a little depressed.

116
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,221
Oh, he is?

117
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:43,755
But, I'm sorry...

118
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,024
Today, I have something to talk about with Rose

119
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,592
Oh, you do...

120
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,561
So - I'm going over to Rose's

121
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,069
Is Yuzo feeling depressed?

122
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,473
I guess he's feeling like a big brother watching

123
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,309
his little sister going off to become some man's wife

124
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,845
Even though they used to fight all the time,

125
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,680
He and Keiko were pretty close.

126
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,718
He's sensitive, isn't he?

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,221
If he takes after his dad

128
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,812
Hey! Keep it down!

129
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,247
I'm sorry!

130
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,395
I'm so happy for Keiko

131
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,464
After separating from her parents, going to live

132
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,600
in an orphanage, then coming to live

133
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,835
with you and Setsuko

134
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,439
She's okay now, but when she first came to live

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,775
with us, it was really rough.

136
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,979
Her rebellious streak was

137
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,715
stronger than most

138
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,284
If I scolded her for anything, she would

139
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,787
tear all the paper off our "shoji" doors

140
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,056
And she'd turn over all the planters in the

141
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,559
whole neighborhood

142
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,894
All along the alleyway

143
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,666
But you and Setsuko accepted her as she was,

144
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,137
and she responded to that feeling.

145
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,541
She said she wanted to be of use to people

146
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,510
and became a nurse

147
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,446
And the result is her happiness now

148
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,050
With everybody's effort, Keiko has finally reached

149
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,286
the point she will have the warmth of her own family

150
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,424
Congratulations, Katsu..

151
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,695
Don't say that, I'm weepy.

152
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,934
If Setsuko was alive, she'd be so happy, wouldn't she?

153
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,405
Ah, you're making me cry

154
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,007
Go ahead, and cry

155
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,475
Cry if you want!

156
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,379
Keiko's finally found happiness

157
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,148
But you sure do cry easily.

158
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,587
Did you tell anyone about it yet?

159
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,389
No, I haven't.

160
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,926
Whatever you do, don't tell Yuzo

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,696
That fool is very fond of Keiko,

162
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,165
So you don't want to upset him, do you?

163
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,135
What should I do?

164
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,237
Should I tell Grandpa?

165
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,810
Or should I go directly to Keiko, and tell her?

166
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,613
Or maybe I shouldn't tell anybody about it

167
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,149
I have a feeling it'll all blow over if

168
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,685
I just don't say anything about it

169
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,222
And I won't be destroying everybody's happiness.

170
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,826
I don't know what to do!

171
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,131
Not saying anything is one way to handle it.

172
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,137
This is an adult's way of thinking, but

173
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:24,209
They're not married yet, so we could close our eyes

174
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,545
to a little affair and not make waves.

175
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:33,318
But will Keiko be happy married to a man like that?

176
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,857
NO...she won't. She won't be happy at all

177
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,860
But it's a problem between the two of them

178
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,361
So I think it's best if they resolve this

179
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,963
between themselves

180
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,332
Then maybe if she senses something suspicious

181
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,200
about the next business trip...

182
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,669
or just by woman's intuition, she

183
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,806
can talk to him about it - I think that's best.

184
00:12:54,807 --> 00:13:00,712
And if she wants to forgive him, that would be okay

185
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,348
You know what they say about overcoming obstacles

186
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,716
making a person stronger

187
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,120
Hitomi

188
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,191
Let's just wait and see what happens for now

189
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,161
If it takes too long for Keiko to realize what's

190
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,997
going on, you can talk to her.

191
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,035
All right. I'll do that

192
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,272
Thank you

193
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,240
You're welcome

194
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,143
Go ahead, and drink

195
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,691
I'm home

196
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,197
I was so happy.

197
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,667
I wanted Dad to give his blessing

198
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,038
Aren't you glad he approved?

199
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,081
Will Keiko be okay?

200
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,087
Just as Rose said, Hitomi was just going to watch

201
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,723
and see what happens, but she couldn't help

202
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,524
worrying about Keiko.

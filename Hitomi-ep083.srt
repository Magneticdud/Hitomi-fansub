CHAPTER 14
Mother Shows Up
Episode 83

2
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,104
I'm home

3
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,308
What? Did you lay out
my bedding

4
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,710
So you could go to
3

5
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,145
Thank you

6
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,215
BLiJiJ i

7
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,821
I talked to Yuzo and Mari
about Shota

8
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,291
And...?

9
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,997
Yuzo said the same
thing you did

10
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,303
He doesn't want to see the
mother who abandoned him

11
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,474
What about Mari?

12
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,078
Mari said it's not
that simple

13
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,216
No matter what kind of
mother she is, she's

14
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:35,154
the only mother he has
in this world, so

15
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,890
she's sure he would
want to see her.

16
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,235
After talking to them,
I feel so much better.

17
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,805
They eally listened to
what I had to say

18
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,277
It's good to have friends,
isn't it?

19
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,145
That's right.

20
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,414
It's good to
have friends

21
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,718
Friendship's something
to treasure

22
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,396
Katsu sure has it
rough, doesn't he?

23
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,699
What do you mean?

24
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,434
Did I say something?

25
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,169
You did.

26
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,672
What is he having a
rough time with?

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,674
I'm not telling you

28
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,975
Why not?

29
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,577
You're a blabbermouth

30
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,546
What are you saying?
I'm a Tsukiji man

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,281
If you tell me not to
tell, I won't tell.

32
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,716
I'll zip my lip

33
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,751
You'll unzip it
right away

34
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,321
Don't talk as if I'm
a cheap wallet

35
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,856
If you're troubled about
something, tell me

36
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,759
We should talk about it 
and try to work it out

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,096
together... Isn't that how
we do things?

38
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,032
I don't believe
you said that

39
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,734
M\*)et

40
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,370
And besides e re
iaiiici xiiiu pyi iÂ«

41
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,039
If Uncle Katsu talked
to you, and you're

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,442
carrying the burden, then
I'll take half of the

43
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,110
burden from you

44
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,280
Twice the happiness, and
half the suffering.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,183
Isn't that what a father
and son is all about?

46
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,385
It's about Shota

47
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,288
What about Shota?

48
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,924
Don't tell anyone..

49
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,325
All right

50
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:20,959
Promise me?

51
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:21,460
Promise me?

52
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,482
Akira! Shota!
Good morning

53
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,523
Good morning. Hitomi

54
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,158
Good morning

55
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,268
I'm leaving!

56
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,287
Akira and Yuria seem
to sense something.

57
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,356
I think so, too

58
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,957
They're very
perceptive.

59
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,495
And Shota seems to be more
cheerful than I expected.

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,700
He's trying to pretend that
it's not bothering him

61
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,369
What goes on in a child's
mind is a lot more

62
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,204
complicated than 
adults realize

63
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,980
Good morning!

64
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,215
Good morning, Hitomi

65
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,850
Don't break any
bowls today

66
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,784

67
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,486
You saying it
will make me even more

68
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,787
conscious of it!

69
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,924
Here's your miso mackerel
large bowl medium serving

70
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,525
with extra pickled
vegetables

71
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,195
Good morning!

Don't give me a

82
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,692
Did you hear about
Shota from Yujiro?

That's ie ri

84

What a problem!

85
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,265
Hey! Will you stop
telling everyone about it?

86
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,367
We don't want the children
to hear about it yet.

87
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,602
I know that!

88
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,570
I'm selective about
who I talk to

89
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,440
Hitomi, just
befr^Ti.

90
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,976
You're not beint selective
about it, are you?

Good morning, Hitomi

Yujiro!

95
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,254
You EPhim about
Shota, didn't you?

96
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,055
Everybody knows about it!

97
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,359
You mean you already
unzipped your lips?

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,861
But this is something
you want to share

99
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,598
You really are a cheap
wallet, aren't you?

100
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,168
Yujiro..

101
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,302
What?

102
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,071
I just got something
really interesting.

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,207
A video...

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,242
Isn't it too early in the
morning for that?

105
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,845

I'm not that good.

119
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,126
I'm talking
about Mari.

120
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,163
But it's high spirited
isn't it?

121
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,065
Even a woman would
fall in love..

122
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,466
Sexy, isn't it?

123
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,337
Add an egg to the orders

00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,613
I want curry..

133
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,081
Okay, I'll make curry
Will you help me?

134
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,918
After we make the curry...

135
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,291
On my way home today
I saw Shota

136
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,829
He kept staring at a
mother and her child

137
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,498
Really?

138
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,138
It's not as simple
as I thought it was

139
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,843
Do you think there are
feelings that he wants

140
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,611
to express, but can't?

141
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,949
He does have feelings he wants
to express, but can't.

142
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,986
It's deep inside
his heart...

143
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,956
And he's carefully
locked it away

144
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,860
So we have to help him
to unlock it

145
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,733
I'm going to
take a bath.

146
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,168
You're going to
take a bath?

147
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,870
It's been awhile

148
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,738
How about if we take
a bath together?

149
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,208
I'll leave the
rest to you

150
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,521
You've grown,
haven't you?

151
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,790
How tall are you now?

152
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,358
I'm 51 inches tall.

153
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,626
Four feet three?
Is t H ighP

154
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,499
Your head got pointed

155
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,437
It's pointed

156
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,011
Close your eyes.

157
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,813
If the soap gets in your
eyes, it'll sting.

158
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,854
Shota?

159
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,790
Do you remember
your mother?

160
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,996
What do you remember
about her?

161
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,833
She used to tell me
stories in bed

162
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,836
She did? What kind
of stories?

163
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,139
Brementown Musicians

164
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,143
Brementown Musicians?

165
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,045
What's the story about?

166
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,748
A dog, a cat, a donkey, and rooster
chase off some robbers

167
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,549
How?

168
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,720
By shouting "Meow! Woof!
Hee haw! Cock-a-doodle-do!"

169
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,356
That would scare the
robbers, wouldn't it?

170
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,592
Boss, & witch lives
inJl^Mouse

171
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,997
I see... Your mother
told you that story?

172
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,735
She's a nice mother
isn't she?

173
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,074
Shota?

174
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,044
Do you want to
see your mother?

175
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,763
I want to see her.

176
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,701
I see, you do?

177
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,872
I want to see her.

178
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,614
In that case, let's
go to see her

179
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,159
Look at that,
it's pointed!

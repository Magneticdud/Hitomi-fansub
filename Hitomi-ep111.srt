What are you going to do if
you do irreversible damage?

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,235
There are times when you need
the courage to give up.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,206
Don't force yourself today, and
wait for another chance

63
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,475
I don't have another chance.

64
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,747
sf we lose coday, Junko
has to go back home

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,982
to her family

66
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,319
She ll have to ta ^fe over
her family's tfsiness.

67
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,189
Yuka wants to m<ike up j
with her father, and

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,392
she wants him to
see her dance

69
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,095

74
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,326
if i don't dance today,
I know I'll regret it

75
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,698
Even if there's even the
Slightest chance that

76
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,967
I can dance, I want to
take the risk.

77
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,739

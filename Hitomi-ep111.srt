Hitomi! There you are!

00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,114
Here she is.

19
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,916
Hitomi...

20
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,653
It's the first time I've
been to Shibuya, so

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,054
I got lost

22
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,558
We just followed
the whole group.

23
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,195

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,696

see you came.
too Iflonfioko

26
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,501
I wondered what that
glitter I saw from

27
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,036
the corner of my eye

28
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,606
Please go to the
judging room

29
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,112
Ken

00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,513
Ymzo

31
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,183
I came to watch.

32
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,319
This is Ken

33
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,722
d vgtie >d flbout y H

34
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,124
I'm Hitomi's
grandfather

35
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,661
This is Hitomi's teacher.

36
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,063
Nice to meet you

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,199
She's pretty

38
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,435
I'm Hitomi's mother

39
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,505
As her teacher, will you
tell Hitomi not to

40
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,473
over extend herself?

41
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,877
What do you mean by that?

42
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,646
Hitomi injured
her foot.

43
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,749
Her foot?

44
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,951
Is it true?

45
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,385
Is it OK?

46
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,055
It's my fault

47
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,924
Hitomi fell when she
chased after me..

48
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,626
That wasn't it...
It's not your fault

49
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,994
But..

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,531
Hello..

51
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,034
Hitomi's team.

52
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,707
Junko and I talked
it over..

53
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,712
We decided that it
might be dangerous.

54
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,717
Hitomi... VII have
o lerthShtes to go

55
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,786
on stage next year or
the year after that..

56
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,756
I couldn't go last
year either

57
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,359
I know.

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,693
I don't care if
I ruin my leg

59
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,528
You mustn't say
things like that.

60
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,765
What if you do
irreversible damage?

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,235
There are times when you need
the courage to give up.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,206
Don't force yourself today, and
wait for another chance

63
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,475
I don't have another chance.

64
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,747
If we lose today, Junko
has to go back home

65
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,982
to her family

66
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,319
She'll have to take over
her family's business.

67
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,189
Yuka wants to make up
with her father, and

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,392
she wants him to
see her dance

69
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,095
Today is our
last chance!

70
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,033
So I want to dance!

71
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,578
Yuka... Junko...

72
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:19,117
Thank you for worrying
about me... I'm sorry.

73
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,923
But.

74
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,326
if I don't dance today,
I know I'll regret it

75
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,698
If there's the
slightest chance that

76
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,967
I can dance, I want to
take the risk.

77
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,739
I think that Junko's in
such a perilous position.

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,609
Yuka anxiously waiting to
see if her father will

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,948
come, Moe wanting to dance
but being manager

80
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,653
instead, how glad I am that
I became friends with

81
00:05:54,654 --> 00:06:01,560
all of you, how grateful I am to
everyone and how sorry

82
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:07,566
I am that I got hurt
Ail of these things will

83
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,902
come together in
our dance today

84
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,207
So tomorrow won't do

85
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,577
I want to dance today

86
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,629
Then dance

87
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,364


88
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,067
There are times
like this.

89
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,436
A time when you just
have to do something

90
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,405
no matter what

91
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,207
Don't you know how
Hitomi feels.. ?

92
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,443
I know but
I'm worried.

93
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,413
Mom...!

94
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,952
Just do your best

95
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,524
But you'd better dance
to win! You're not

96
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,759
doing this just
for the memories.

97
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,461
I know

98
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,664
Take on the bufflenx)
everybody's life.

99
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,167
and dance like you've
never danced before

100
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,701
Who some Ring
happens o your tea,

101
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,370
and you have to go
to the hospital..!

102
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,071
Thank you!

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,207
Hitomi..

104
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,009
Be careful!

105
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,282
Put your leg up

106
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,217
Shall we wrap it?

107
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,952
Please

108
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,768
We'll be starting
in 30 minutes

109
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,307
Kazu!

110
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,476
What do you want?

111
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,147
The same thing happened
to us...It was me

112
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,382
The first time the three of
us danced together

113
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,117
in New York

114
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,020
I got over-enthusiastic
during our practice

115
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,823
the night before TitJ
I twisted my ankle

116
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,726
But Eiji saved me

117
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,364
He was awesome

118
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,202
He told me that he taught
his little sister how

119
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,037
to do it, too

120
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,709
I need your help

121
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,844
r itrdbc

122
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,616
Entry number one

123
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,585
With their ul Is'
hip hop e jhfere's

124
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,121
WAKANACHI! Give them
a hand!

125
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,073
You're good,
aren't you?

126
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,943
Of course! Kazu's a
master at taping

127
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,178
A master...?

128
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,481
Can't you tell
she's a master?

129
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,384
Did someone teach you
how to do this?

130
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,986
My brother taught me.

131
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,723
He helped Ken and me
so many times

132
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,497
I started dancing when
I was in middle school,

133
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,833
and when my brother found
out, he told me to learn

134
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,802
how to tape injuries

135
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,472
Every time he came home
to Osaka, he'd teach me

136
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,274
how to do this

137
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,146
He said it would definitely
come in handy one day

138
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,283
Because I could do this
for the veteran dancers

139
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,285
who took good care of me

140
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,192
mp uuiiu.. stand up

141
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,334
Be careful

142
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,814
It's perfectly OK!

143
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,049
It's OK!

144
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,020
Kazu...?

145
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,256
Thank you very much

146
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,025
Thank you

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,834

00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,010
ROSE MARY will dance

151
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:53,952


152
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,323
Thank you

153
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,292
I appreciate
what you did

154
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,170
I really loved
my brother

155
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,842
I'm suffering, too.

156
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,317
What am I supposed to

157
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,137
How is it?

158
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,039

I'm sure

161
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,842
Are you really sure?

162
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,110
I'm really sure!

163
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:52,944
All right!

164
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,512
Let's do it one
more time!

165
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,787
Let's go on to
our next entry

166
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,789
If we didn't become
dancers we would

167
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,958
have become salesmen.

168
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,162
Their specialty dance is the
business card exchange

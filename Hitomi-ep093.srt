If you can forgive me,
will you come and

10
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,235
live with me on
the island?

11
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,244
Let's put an end to this
loneliness already

12
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,517
Will the two of you come
and live with me?

13
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,586
Bring Shota with you.

14
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,194
After talking a long time,
Mikie agreed with her

15
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,163
father's suggestion

16
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,837
The two of them went to the
child care counseling center

17
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,539
and explained the
situation.

18
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,675
I'm very sorry for all the
trouble that Mikie caused

19
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:29,014
After hearing what they
proposed to do,

20
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,251
the child care counseling center
decided to check if

21
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:36,155
the environment would be
suitable for Shota

And once they came to a

26
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,776
and the others went to
see the Ippongi family.

27
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,749
Mikie's father's income
is very stable, and

29
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,289
Toshio has never remarried,
so lives alone in a

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,790
single-family home

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,425
and there's a grade
school nearby too.

32
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,061
But on don't know if Shota
would agree to it, or not.

33
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:21,967
Of course, ee intend to put
Shota's opinion first

34
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,737
He might feel lonely if
he's going to be so far

35
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,239
away from this house.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,141
That's true.

37
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,477
I'll talk to Shota and

39
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,449
If he's agreeable, then
we'll have Shota meet

40
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,652
with his grandfather at
the center once

41
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,356
All right.

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,925
We're counting on
your cooperation

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,468
So we were wondering what
you think of living in

44
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,840
Izu Oshima with your mother
and Toshio, your grandfather

45
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,014
Your mother has agreed
to it, so we want to

46
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,050
know how you feel about it.

47
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,159
What do you think, Shota?

48
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,430
It's up to you... It hasn't
been decided yet

49
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,535
Either way is fine with us.

50
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,372
Just tell us what
you think, Shota.

51
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,212
Just think it over
very carefully

52
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,020


53
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,425
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm together

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,294
with my mom

55
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,799

56
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,069
As long as you're with
your mother, you don't

57
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,004
care where you go?

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,876
As long as I'm with my mom,
anywhere is fine with me.

59
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,682
Ifujht... tell your
mother that then.

60
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,042
Here you go

61
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,110
Thanks

62
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,652
Shota's mother made a
good decision

63
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,422
It's probably the best
place in the world

64
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,459
that she can live
without worry

65
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,894
It's good for Shota and
his mother

66
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,066
That's probably true

67
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,869
What is she going to
do about work?

68
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,940
She'll find something through
one of their relatives

69
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,509
Is that right?

70
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,884
But he's really going

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,354
Are you feeling lonely?

72
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,191
Of course!

73
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,661
It's across the ocean..

74
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,196
What are you saying?

75
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,866
You can get there in less than
two hours on the boat now

76
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,534
It's closer than Osaka

77
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,469
But..

78
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,809
Shota's going away.

79
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:04,189
It's okay for you
to cry here, but

80
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,126
be sure you smile
in front of Shota

81
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,715
Shota's.. going to
"Anko Tsubaki"

82
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:37,722
He said he doesn't carae
where he goes as long

83
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,358
as he's with his mother

84
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,830
It's enough to
make you cry

85
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,098
Katsu

86
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,735
It makes me sad that
he's going to leave

87
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,705
to .arfwith Shota.

88
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,309
You must be feeling like
the father of the bride.

89
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,812
Even though you know he's
leaving... You know that

90
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:07,185
it's for Shota's sake, and even
though you're happy.

91
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,088
It still makes you sad.

92
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,626
Katsu.

93
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,265
You did a fine job of
raising Shota

94
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,005
Thank you

95
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,289
I'm so sad

96
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,469

will meet Toshio.

I'm sorry I haven't been
able to see you, Shota

103
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,300
Were you lonely?

104
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,702
No.. I wasn't lonely
because I knew I was

105
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,370
going to see you.

106
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,008
They told you about your
grandpa, didn't they?

107
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,646
He's here now

108
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,015
He came to see you.

109
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,751
Can I call him in?

110
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,991


111
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,140
Are you Shota?

112
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,350
I'm your grandpa.

113
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,833
Yes? Come in

114
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,935
Excuse me

115
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,037
How is it going?

116
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,405
It's going well.

117
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,174
As soon as he saw Toshio's
face, Shota smiled

118
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,244
They're drawing pictures
together right now

119
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,380
They are? I'm glad.

120
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,615
It's a relief, isn't it?

121
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,651
It's great, isn't it?

122
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,853
What are they drawing?

123
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,087

124
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,626
After the first meeting,
he three of them met

125
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,729
a number of times.

126
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,068
Shota! Dad!

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,533
Wow!

6
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,235
Amazing

7
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,170
We're going to
dance here

8
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,240
The Tokyo preliminaries
will start

9
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,409
the day after tomorrow, so
Hitomi and the others

10
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,811
came to check out
the competition venue

11
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,882
Good morning!

12
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,754
So those two are really going
to dance in the preliminaries.

13
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,922
That's right

14
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,091
It's the return of the 
legendary Cheapass

15
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,503
Hey Ken

16
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,940
I'm glad you're going
to compete with me

17
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,912
Kazu

18
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,289
You said it, right?

19
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,858
That only Eiji knows
what's in his heart

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,127
What about it?

21
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,396
You're right about that

22
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,332
That's why Ray
and I suffered

23
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,069
By dancing, we're going
to put and end to it

24
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,906
and move forward.
So watch us

25
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,910
Say what you want.

26
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,412
Let's go

27
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,725
March 2008

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,565
The preliminaries are already 
the day after tomorrow!

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,767
Shall we do it?

30
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,705
For the few days before the
preliminaries, Hitomi and

31
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,774
the others used Rose's
studio to practice as

32
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,342
much as they could

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,954
This year, I'll definitely be
There since I couldn't

34
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,622
make it last year

35
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,425
I'm rooting for you
So do your best.

36
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,494
Do your best!

37
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,401
Here you go..
Something to share.

38
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,737
Thank you!

39
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,074
Here's dried bonito
(katsuobushi for good luck

40
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,376
has "katsu" - the word for "win.")

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,212
This is a pre-celebration,
fresh Tsukiji sashimi

42
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,115
That's really extravagant.

43
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,885
Dinner turned into a send
off party for ROSE MARY

44
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,254
Wait a minute!

45
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,257
Akira's not here.
Is it OK to start?

46
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,025
He went over to play 

47
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,827
with his friend and hasn't

48
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,762
made even one call home.

49
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,331
He passed his entrance exam

50
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,133
so he's relieved and letting
loose a bit

51
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,035
That's good

52
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,104
You're put aside a plate
for Akira right?

53
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,107
Of course

54
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,143
In that case, we'll go
ahead without waiting for him.

55
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,151
Come to think of it, when I 
first came here,

56
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,654
everyone came and brought
food to eat like this.

57
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,888
tciidn tlhe *

58
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,390
That's right.

59
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,325
Time flies, doesn't it?
It's already been a year

60
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,761
You made a play for her, 
didn't you?

61
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,095
I did?

62
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,498
When you heard Hitomi
was twenty, you told her,

63
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,100
I'm 33. I'm available
for you anytime

64
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,703
Let's just eat!
Don't bring up boring stuff...

65
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,638
Wait a minute
I made that!

66
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,541
Thank you

67
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,145
Anyway just do your best

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,246
We'll be rooting
for you

69
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,647
We will!

70
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,683


71
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,851
Everyone eat up!

72
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,086


73
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,593
Coming to this house 
is really relaxing

74
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,763
It really is - I wonder why 

75
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:36,601
Everyone's boisterous
and cheerful

76
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,504
Like one big family

77
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,375
It really is,
isn't it?

78
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,445
I'm stuffed

79
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,579
I'm stuffed

80
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,948
I want to just go
right to sleep

81
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,583
You can't do that

82
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,819
We're going back to the
studio to practice.

83
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,887
Okay.. I'm ready

84
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,856
Yuka...?

85
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,026
Do you think your father
will come to watch?

86
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,163
Just do what you
a to do

87
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,798
That's what we've let
you do until now

88
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,035
Yuka!

89
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,073
I want him to see me
the way I am now

90
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,245
If he does, I feel like we
can be a family again

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,915
I wonder if he'll come...

92
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,519
My brother's definitely
going to come

93
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,688
He wants to be there
to see me lose

94
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,890
Dad definitely wants you to 
succeed him at the restaurant.

95
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,258
There's only you

96
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,960
You want to make the effort
to achieve your dream

97
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,628
It's just chasing a lie


98
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,931
That's right, you promised
him you'd quit dancing

99
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,800
if you lose, didn't you?

100
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,168
I want to win!

101
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,071
I want to get
into the finals

102
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,907
I don't want to
see his gloating face

103
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,542
I don't want
to see it

104
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,578
What's wrong, Moe?

105
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,083
Just thinking about it
made me mad

106
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,422
Everyone, let's definitely  
win, OK?

107
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,366
The part with three of you...

108
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:20,305
The angle seems o
a oil 3 JjjUjUVIcu

109
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,840
Ve're ndhn^yn

110
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,378
One more time!

111
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,821
You have to come down
lower, Hitomi.

112
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,757
A little more

113
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,927
Lower, lower...

114
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,354
How was that?

115
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,355
Perfect!

116
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,524
I think so.

117
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,293
I think so, too

118
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,329
What about you, Yuka

119
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,700
It's the best we
can do now.

120
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,272
If we don't give our best
performance tomorrow,

121
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,740
we won't win.

122
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,011
I know...

123
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,052
Tomorrow is the
preliminaries.

124
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,788
Let's get a good night's
rest tonight so we'll

125
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,390
be in excellent condition
tomorrow

126
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,660
Hard wokers - this is my treat

127
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,274
Hello...What is it,
Grandpa?

128
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,242
Akira isn't home yet

129
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,178
Akira's not home yet?

130
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,448
It's 10:30!

131
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,520
So can you keep an eye out
for him on your way home?

132
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,023
I'll stop by the park on
the way home, too.

133
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,996
Overlook it just
this once.

134
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,299
He's at an age when he
wants to play around

135
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,803
But it's already 10:30
What is he doing anyway?

136
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,876
I'm so glad I made
it here in time

137
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,277
Mari!

138
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,447
The preliminaries are
tomorrow, right?

139
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,516
I wanted to give
you this

140
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,483
What is it?

141
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,218
It's rosemary
aroma oil

142
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,221
I gave you some the
last time too

143
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,923
I wanted to give you
some new

144
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,025
Like they suggest at the store, 
just spritz a little in the air

145
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,361
Thank you!

146
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,931
Don't think about how well
you have to dance

147
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,800
Just listen closely to
the music, and

148
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,302
believe in the beat of
life that's bubbling

149
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,438
up deep within your body.

150
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,276
Let's all say the
words of love

151
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,744
You all know it,
don't you?

152
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,979
I know it

153
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,383
Say it really loud..

154
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,686
Dance is the
spark of life

155
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,362
I see... Akira's finally
liberated from studying

156
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,230
It's the most fun
time for him

157
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,967
That's right. So I think
he's changed modes

158
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,137
Dance school will be ending
soon, too, won't it?

159
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,643
Isn't that Akira?

160
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,244
Akira.

161
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,846
Hey!

162
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,082
Come back here!

163
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,091
That hurts!

164
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,459
Hitomi!

165
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,196
Did you hit something?

166
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,198
Are you OK?

167
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,634
I think I twisted
my ankle

168
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,111
It's okay... See?
Nothing's wrong

169
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,613
Don't overdo it

170
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,914
I'm sorry

171
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,349
I'm okay. I'm fine

172
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,018
Never mind that

173
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,853
Worry about Grandpa
He's really angry

174
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,321
I know

175
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,392
When they got home
Katsutaro was waiting

176
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,428
for them with his
arms crossed!

177
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,265
Go on inside

178
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,869
Let's hear what you
have to say, Akira

179
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,138
Why were you so late?

180
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,775
And why didn't you even
call once to say you were

181
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,677
going to be late?

182
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,014
I think you know
this by now,

183
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,483
but you mustn't lie, so
just tell me the truth.

184
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,421
I have a friend named
Shimatani from the

185
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,756
basketball team

186
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,526
So you were playing with
this friend, Shimatani?

187
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,264
He wanted to see a movie,
and he said we could get

188
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,633
in the 7PM showing

189
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,002
It's no good for middle
school students to go

190
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,904
to see a movie at night!

191
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,574
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,809
What did you see7

193
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,511
An action movie...

194
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,547
Shimatani wanted something
to relieve his stress.

195
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,082
Why?

196
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,588
He failed the entrance
exam for the same

197
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,690
school as me.

198
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,762
So he's going to his
second choice.

199
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,099
We said we'd go to the
same school. But only

200
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,901
I passed the exam.

201
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,173
He was depressed, so wanted
to cheer him up.

202
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,209
To let him know that even if we're
going to different schools,

203
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,345
we'll always be friends.

204
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,213



205
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,449
Got it.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:04,649
I understand the
circumstances

207
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:04,949
I understand the
circumstances...

208
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:10,021
You were late because you
were talking to him about it?

209
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,523
That's right.

210
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,827
OK Akira.

211
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,230
I think you did
a good thing.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,903
But out of consideration for
the people waiting at home

213
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,005
for you, you should
have called.

214
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,575
If this happens again, be
sure you call home

215
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,344
I'm sorry

216
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,216
You're going to cheer
Hitomi on tomorrow,

217
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,118
aren't you? We have to
get up early in the

218
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,754
morning, so go on
up to bed already

219
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,925
Good night.

220
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,504
What was that?

221
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,733
There was just a little
bit of discomfort

222
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,720
Don't fail me now, ankle

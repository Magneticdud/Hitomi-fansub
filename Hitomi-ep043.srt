00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:09,821
HITOMI

00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:14,764
CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 43

3
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,773
They're holding
an audition...

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,776
The song will be the
d-Darts debut song.

5
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,712
You can do it solo
or as a group.

6
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:41,481
You'll make a great weapon
when it comes to impact.

7
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,416
I'm a weapon?

8
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:47,120
But your dancing had the
one thing that was

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,721
most important...

10
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,990
You were enjoying yourselves
when you were dancing...

11
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,992
Watching you two
was enjoyable.

12
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,396
Excuse me...

13
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,531
Do you want something
at our house?

14
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,333
No... It's nothing.

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,415
We're leaving, Hitomi!

16
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:19,751
We're leaving, Dad!

17
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,955
They're full of energy,
aren't they?

18
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,490
What about you?

19
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,325
Now that you failed the audition...

20
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:29,461
I'm over it already.

21
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:33,531
I can't be depressed forever
just because I failed one audition.

22
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,001
Now I know I'm a lousy
dancer, but I got to

23
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,204
be friends with Yuka
and Junko.

24
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,673
I see... do your best.

25
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:43,541
The children are
rooting for you.

26
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:48,112
Did you see Akira?

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,781
No, I didn't.

28
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,050
Hey!

29
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,720
Akira! You're going
to be late.

30
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,590
Akira!

31
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,259
What are you doing?

32
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,061
You're going to be late.

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,602
I'm leaving!

34
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,142
I'm leaving now.

35
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,180
Hitomi?

36
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,083
Good morning.

37
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,318
What's wrong?

38
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:33,089
Akira was touching
his hair...

39
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:37,360
Anyone touches their hair...
That is... if they have hair.

40
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,329
It just seems unusual.

41
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:49,471
I wonder if he found
a girlfriend?

42
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:51,006
Wait a minute!

43
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,241
I didn't notice
any signs...

44
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,111
The other day, there was a
girl standing out front,

45
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,881
and staring at the nameplate
outside our house.

46
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,149
She looked like she might
be in middle school...

47
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,151
Maybe it's her.

48
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,488
Tsukishima South
Middle School

49
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,876
Shimada...?

50
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:29,610
Shimada Naoko

51
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,278
Sano...

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,581
Good morning.

53
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:38,485
Here... Thanks.

54
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,488
You read them already?

55
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,956
That was really fast.

56
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,192
I'll bring you more.

57
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:51,965
Sano...

58
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,267
What is it?

59
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,236
The other day when I was
out walking, I just

60
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:58,138
happened to go by
your house.

61
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,507
There were a lot of different last
names on the nameplate.

62
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,575
Are you living
with relatives?

63
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,145
I'm...

64
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,714
...a foster child.

65
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,816
Foster child?

66
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,753
My father and siblings aren't
my real father or siblings.

67
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,556
But they're like a
real family to me.

68
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,325
I see...

69
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,431
Can I come over
to your house?

70
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,069
Midterms are coming up soon.

71
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,737
I'd like you to show me
how to do some of the

72
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:33,572
math problems that
I don't understand.

73
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,141
What about today?

74
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,877
There are days when I have
to help out, but today

75
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,946
I don't have to...

76
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,382
Really? I'll come by
in the evening.

77
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:47,986
I'll see you then.

78
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:01,799
Akira's at that age now...

79
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,869
I don't see what's wrong with
having a girlfriend or two.

80
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,538
He must be quite popular...

81
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:10,207
After working in Tsukiji, he
seems to have matured a bit.

82
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:13,444
Girls don't miss that
kind of thing.

83
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:17,381
Really? Then he must
be really popular.

84
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,383
It's okay for Akira...

85
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,452
But the problem
is my dad.

86
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:23,453
The way he's acting
at his age...

87
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:27,424
What happened with Yu and his date
with Mari when they went to Kamakura?

88
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,092
How did it go?

89
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,228
I don't want to talk
about that...

90
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:32,395
He's head over heels...

91
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,830
Actually, he's beyond that.

92
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:35,832
This is great.

93
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,334
Isn't it?

94
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,169
If you put in here,
you won't ever lose it.

95
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,136
Thank you.

96
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,505
I don't know how you find
chic things like this.

97
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,507
I'll put it in right away.

98
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,910
What did she give you?

99
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,046
It's a "chakin-bukuro"...
(Tea-cloth pouch)

100
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,214
You put money in it.

101
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:53,249
In Kamakura. there's a shrine
called "Zeniarai Benten"

102
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,518
(Coin-washing Benten God)
and if you wash money

103
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,887
there, money is supposed
to accumulate.

104
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:02,324
So we went there, and we each
washed five-yen coins, but

105
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:05,160
if we put it in our wallets, we
might spend it by mistake.

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,896
So Mari bought these, so we
can put our five-yen coins

107
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:11,266
inside, and keep it as
a good-luck charm.

108
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:14,636
That way we won't lose it.

109
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:16,438
These were just right, so
I bought two different

110
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,739
colored ones for us.

111
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,375
So we have a matching pair
of "chakin-bukuro".

112
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:25,613
I have some shopping to do.
I'll see you later, Yu.

113
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:27,315
Goodbye.

114
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,817
Thank you.

115
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:31,819
Matching "chakin"...

116
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,622
Sounds like you had
fun in Kamakura.

117
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,624
We sure did...

118
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,426
Why don't the two
of you go?

119
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,096
Never mind Kamakura already.
I've had enough of it.

120
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,030
Don't be jealous.

121
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,832
Why don't you go to a "kyabakura"?
(cabaret club)

122
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,734
You go to a "kyabakura",
and I'll go to Kamakura.

123
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,637
Give me a break!

124
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,752
Junko! Good morning.

125
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,522
Good morning.

126
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,558
What's wrong?
You have no spirit.

127
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,593
How could I have any?

128
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,228
We failed the audition.

129
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,530
It's in the past now.

130
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,567
Maybe it was a mistake
to pair up with you.

131
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,169
Why did I tell you
I'd dance with you?

132
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,205
Don't say that now.

133
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,414
What's going on?

134
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,183
Good morning.

135
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,652
KEN is giving lessons to the
ones who passed the audition.

136
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,288
Let me see...

137
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,196
The kids from the other
schools are here, too.

138
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,364
He's really strict.

139
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,766
He' s totally different from
when you're talking to him.

140
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,338
You can come inside,
and watch...

141
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:01,906
It'll be a good
lesson for you.

142
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:06,478
Shall we try dancing once?

143
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,521
It's a lesson for the taping
of the promotion video.

144
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:22,927
Hitomi was really surprised by...

145
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,462
The difficulty of their
movements, the way

146
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,597
their bodies moved, the
uniformity and the high

147
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:28,832
degree of perfection that
was expected of you during

148
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,235
the professional level lesson.

149
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,037
And it made her
impatient...

150
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,946
It's not at all
what I want.

151
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,615
You have to listen to the
music more closely.

152
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,784
Once more.

153
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,202
That's all for today.

154
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:07,970
Thank you.

155
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:17,112
Good work, Kyoko, Chisato
and Kuriko.

156
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,715
I know it's hard, but we're
going to start my lesson now.

157
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,618
We'll start in five minutes.

158
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:32,928
I'll see you later.

159
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:38,867
KEN!

160
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:43,538
The miso mackerel was delicious.

161
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,874
Please come again.

162
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,408
If I have a chance...

163
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:52,146
I was watching your lesson.
It was awesome...

164
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,881
It made me impatient...

165
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:57,551
All I can tell you is
to try your best.

166
00:10:58,653 --> 00:10:59,553
I will.

167
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,188
See you.

168
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,631
It's not use getting impatient.

169
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,500
When you get impatient,
you start to sweat...

170
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,202
The sweat will come
dripping down,

171
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,238
wetting the floor, and
making you slip and fall.

172
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:20,507
I can't help but
be impatient...

173
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,742
If I don't keep up, the
gap will keep growing,

174
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,511
and I'll be left behind.

175
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:33,453
Excuse me.

176
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,888
Yes?

177
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,257
Yes...?

178
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,061
I'm a classmate of Sano from
Tsukishima South Middle

179
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,063
School... My name is
Shimada Naoko.

180
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,265
Is that right?

181
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm Akira's father.

182
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,436
I'm pleased to meet you.

183
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:51,804
What can we do
for you today?

184
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:53,672
Our midterms are coming up
soon, so I came to have

185
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,708
Sano help me with my math.

186
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,610
Is that right?
Hitomi...

187
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,881
Just a minute...

188
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:06,318
She's the girl that was looking
at the nameplate the other day.

189
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,555
It's just as thought...
It's his girlfriend.

190
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,591
I'm sorry...

191
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,094
Will you call Akira?

192
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,364
What am I saying?

193
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,067
Akira! You have a visitor.

194
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,303
Come on in.

195
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,771
I'm sorry the house
is such a mess.

196
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,141
This is Yuria and Shota...
Akira's younger siblings.

197
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,843
Hello.

198
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,678
I'm Hitomi...

199
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,546
I saw you out front the
other day, didn't I?

200
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,747
That's right.

201
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,082
Hello...

202
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,217
Shimada...

203
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,785
Sano...

204
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,621
Come on up.

205
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:46,757
If you'll excuse me...

206
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:48,759
Go right ahead.

207
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,898
Hitomi...

208
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,270
Did you hear him?

209
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,805
"Come on up."

210
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,311
Akira has a girlfriend...

211
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:09,946
She's really cute.

212
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:11,447
Let's serve tea.

213
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,882
Shall we make
English tea?

214
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,518
I'll take out cookies.

215
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,587
Let's go, and
check it out.

216
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,123
This hardly happens...

217
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,302
I'll take this to them.

218
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:37,172
Hitomi...

219
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,242
Leave the door open...

220
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:41,510
The door...?

221
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,379
We don't want anything
to happen...

222
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,718
I'm getting nervous...

223
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:52,420
I feel like a mother who's
meeting her son's first

224
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,990
girlfriend, or something
like that.

225
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:58,460
Take it before
it gets cold.

226
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,635
Hey! Go away.

227
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:18,979
Akira...

228
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:21,015
Yes?

229
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:22,249
I'm coming in.

230
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:27,888
I brought you
some tea.

231
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,790
I'll serve it.

232
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,458
Thank you.

233
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,831
Thank you.

234
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:51,511
Naoko's appearance has brought a little
excitement to the Ippongi family.

5
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,125
I thought you went to
your part-time jbb

6
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,593
We met up with BLUE SHOES

7
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,642
Why did you come here?

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,114
Because I didn't hear
your mentors are going to

9
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,316
enter Dance Beat yet.

10
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,555
We were headed for the
monja shop to give

11
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,658
them a little incentive when
we ran into these Mo

12
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,531
I heard you have a
studio here

13
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,667
Can we use it?

14
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,204
Beautiful madame..

15
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,041
Sure

16
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,453
They're good.

17
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,624
They've gotten even better
since last time

18
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,840
Thank you, beautiful
madame

19
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,509
You're welcome

20
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,013
What do you think?

21
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,049
You can see for yourselves that
you can't even compete

22
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,684
with us, can't you?

23
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,053
I have a dynamite body

24
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,959
Tell Ken and Ray not to run
away but to compete with us

25
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,995
Shall we go?

26
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,830
Wait a minute

27
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,066
What is it?

28
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,034
I want to talk
to you'V 1 one.

29
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,109
What is it?

30
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:09,915
Why do you keep harassing
Ken and Ray like that?

31
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,885
It's obvious, isn't it?
I'm avenging my brother

32
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,359
Those two killed
my brother.

33
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,963
I heard it was
an accident

34
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,132
A motorcycle accident.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,168
it was no accident

36
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,107
They killed my
brother's heart

37
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,076
That's why he took
his own life

38
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,747
What do you mean "they
killed his heart"?

39
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:47,352
My brother and Ray were
seeing each other, but

40
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,488
Ken stole her away

41
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,396
My brother was betrayed by
his best friend and

42
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:02,267
his sweetheart

43
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,439
I'm sure it's just a
misunderstanding.

44
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,042
Ray and Ken aren't
like that.

45
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,746
Are you sure you're not
overestimating them?

46
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,624
Have you ever heard the
phrase dance is life?

47
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,398
When a person dances,
it expresses his life

48
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,605
If that's how you feel,
don't think you'll

49
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,343
know how good a dancer
you really are

50
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,514
It looks to me like you're
using your dancing as a

51
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,150
way to vent your
bitter feelings.

52
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,287
I don't think you
should do that

53
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,322
That's not what
dancing is..

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,560
It's something that people
can enjoy watching,

55
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,730
where you can make friends
with people you dance

56
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,233
with, and something
that has dream

57
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,905
You have no right to lecture
me about dancing

58
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,679
1 kezu*

59
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,459
You should just
let her be

60
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,695
I don't care for
people like that

61
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,813
Is she thinking
about Ken?

62
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,982
Do you hm they're
dating

63
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,784
o, I'm TW

64
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,685
^ftou hear 5?

65
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,158
It's not easy getting your feelings
across to people, is it?

66
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,095
You n|el Ken how
you feel about him?

67
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,763
No!

68
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,932
Then is it Yuzo?

69
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,134
Definitely not!

70
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,970
I'm just talking about
people in general

71
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,406
see pebple
fin ge ^rai

72
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,643
Speaking about getting your
feelings across, the son

73
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,012
f the people behind i\ew
is iina going o marry

74
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,080
the girl next door
isn't he?

75
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,350
He's been trying
for 10 years

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Ten years?

77
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,956
He's been trying to get
his feelings across

78
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,424
for ten years, and
they're finally getting

79
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,859
married now

80
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,828
It really is difficult
getting your feelings

81
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,196
across to others.

82
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,964
It is, isn't it?

83
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,468
It doesn't go the way
you want it, does it?

84
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,374
Thank you for all
the memories

85
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,244
Yuria is graduating
from Higashi Tsukishima

86
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,879
Grade School

87
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,555
Dad's really in a good
mood, isn't he?

88
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,524
He's probably relieved
because you passed

89
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,825
your entrance exams

90
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,695
How are things going
with your love life?

91
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,764
I told you, it's
not like that!

92
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,300
That's because you're
a late bloomer

93
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,969
That's probably it

94
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,737
I don t want to hear that from
someone in grade school.

95
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,105
Are you home, Katsu?

96
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,607
He's in the bath
right now

97
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,212
Your grandpa doesn't need
a karaoke room, does he?

98
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,082
Are you going to
Mari's place?

99
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,851
I've fully recovered
from my cold

100
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,555
Katsu?

101
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,124
After you get out of the bath,
let's go to "Matsuri"

102
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:46,725
After you get out of the bath,
let's go to "Matsuri"

103
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,095
I'll be out of the
bath soon.

104
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,664
Thank you for the
invitation

105
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,837
Here's to your
recovery, Yu

106
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,839
Thank you

107
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,441
Are you fully
recovered?

108
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,844
I actually stretched it
out longer so I could

109
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,580
leave Yuzo in charge
of the shop.

110
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,449
He's not ready yet

111
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,618
No good, huh?

112
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,021
I know he's trying, but
he just runs around

113
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,957
in circles... Once he gets
an idea in his head, he

114
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,092
can't see anything else

115
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,528
He gets on the phone to
take orders, but he

116
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,464
puts too much of a burden
on the employees.

117
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,601
When you're in a position
of managing others, you

118
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,603
have to able to see
what's going on all

119
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,171
around you, don't you?

120
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,473
That's just it. 
He can't do it

121
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,742
He's not ready to be in a
management position yet.

122
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,580
Does that make
yo ' n a way?

123
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,083
I'd be even happier
if my son was a full-fledged

124
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,352
adul and could tell me
to leave the business

125
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,822
in his hands, so I can
take it easy

126
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,926
I don't see what's wrong
with running around in

127
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,962
circles...it's a lot
better than not moving

128
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,863
at all, isn't it?

129
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,466
Eventually, the cogs in
the wheel might catch,

130
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,235
and start turning the
way it's supposed to

131
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,938
I guess I'll just
have to wait then

132
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,573
As the saying goes

133
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,276
If winter comes, then spring
can't be that far behind

134
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,613
Come to think of it,
when rnrt comes

135
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,048
it'll be a year since
Hitomi came

136
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,251
That's right... A lot
happened, but she's

137
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,121
part of the family now

138
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,057
She s adorable
isn't she?

139
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,193
I'll bet you feel that
you don't want to give her

140
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,728
away to any man now.

141
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,031
That might be true, but
it doesn't work

142
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,432
that way, does it?

143
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,102
After all, she'll be 21 soon,
and a full-grown lady

144
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,471
I heard she found
a boyfriend

145
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,072
Who?

146
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,007


147
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:42,974
ii 6JjH ' X

148
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,410
I heard about it, too
1ako ojd ife

149
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,312
He's a good-looking dancer

150
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,048
I heard he was really cool
Yuzo was really upset

151
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,352
You're talking about Ken.


152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,121
See? You knew about him.

153
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,558
I asked her if Ken
was her boyfriend

154
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,094
and she told me,
absolutely not.

155
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,964
She won't admit it
to you, Katsu

156
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,699
She's just embarrassed

157
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,334
I don't believe that.

158
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,769
He's not her boyfriend

159
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,971
We're talking
about Hitomi...

160
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,839
She's still a child

161
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,574
You just said she's a
full-grown lady

162
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,742
Didn't he?

163
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,010
She's not popular
/ith IT s

164
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,513
What are you saying?
Storm's ery c e

165
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,847
That's right.

166
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,715
No, she's not.

167
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,616
Yes, she is!

168
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,818
Her family might think
she's cute, but

169
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,054
others wouldn't
think so

170
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,122
He's getting all
worked up

171
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,290
How adorable

172
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,958
She doesn't feminine
appeal at all.

173
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,295
i^ne... iwu ini^tf

174
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,030
I thin Tiris all...

175
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,632
Thank you for always
thinking of us

176
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,666
Don't worry about it.

177
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,501
Next time I make something,
I'll bring some over

178
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,669

brother's death by settling
it on the dance floor

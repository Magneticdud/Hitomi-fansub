00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:09,915
.Why %do you keep harassing
-KEN and RAY like that?

31
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,885
It's obvious, isn't it?
m avengingtnyrf)rpther

32
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,359
Those two killed
my brpther.

33
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,963
I heard it was
an accident

34
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,132
A dtorcycle acc de 1

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,168
it was no accident*

36
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,107
They killed my
brother's heart

37
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,076
That's why tie took
his own ife1

38
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,747
Whit do you mean "they
killed his heart"?

39
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:47,352
My brother artfi RAY were
seeing eachjpther, but

40
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,488
KEN stole^er away

41
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,396
My >pther<was betrayed £y
this rus e Iriend and

42
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:02,267
his sweetheart

43
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,439
p m sure it's just a
misunderstanding.

44
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,042
jRAY,and KEN aren t
Mike that.

45
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,746
Are you sure you're not
overestimating them9

46
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,624
Have you ever heard the
phrase dance is life ?

47
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,398
When a person dances,
it expresses his life

48
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,605
If that's how you feel,
don t think you'll

49
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,343
liow how good ^ dancer
you really are

50
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,514
It looks to me like you're
using your dancing as a

51
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,150
way to vent your
bitter feelings.

52
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,287
I don t think you
should do hat

53
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,322
That's not Wh 1
dancing is..

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,560
It's somethin tfi Vfteople
can enjoy watching,

55
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,730
where you can mak "friends
with the people you dance

56
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,233
With, and something
that has drea ^

57
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,905

59
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,459
You should just
let her be

60
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,695
I don't care for
people like that

88
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,524

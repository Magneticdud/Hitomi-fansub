CHAPTER 14
Mother Shows Up
Episode 84

2
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,428
Shota? Do you want
to see your mother?

3
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,975
I want to see her.

4
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,014
You do want
to see her?

5
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,750
I do

6
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,025
All right. Let's go
to see her then.

7
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,483
Good night

8
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,129
Shota..

9
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,898
I heard

10
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,800
You did?

11
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,438
I'll call Mr. Wakayama
tomorrow

12
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,009
We need to tell Akira
and Yuria, too

13
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,249
What's going to
happen now?

14
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,890
Shota and his mother
will meet once, and

15
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,626
if there aren't any
problems, they'll

16
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,495
have a number
of meetings

17
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,233
If Mr. Wakayama and the
others are satisfied

18
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,804
that everything's OK, then
they'll live together

19
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,145
It's sad, isn't it?

20
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,954
We should be happy

21
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,424
He'll be going back
to his mother

22
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,994
He'll be going back
to his real parent.

23
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,930
Before we eat, I have
something to say

24
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,971
Actually Shota's mother
contacted the child care

25
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:44,843
counseling center, and
she wants to see Shota

26
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,553
Shota said it's OK
so he will be

27
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,357
seeing her in the
near future

28
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,628
I don't know what's going
to happen after that, but

29
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,832
Shota will be going to the
child care counseling

30
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:14,106
center every so often from
now on. So don't worry

31
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,776
That's all I have to say.

32
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,545
Shall we eat?

33
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,523
Eat lots of "natto"
(fermented soy beans)

34
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,265
Is that right? Shota said
wants to see her..

35
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,835
I asked him what he
remembered about his

36
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:49,841
mother, and he said she used
to tell him stories in bed

37
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,615
I could tell that he
misses her, after all

38
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,818
I understand

39
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,388
We'll make the arrangements
with his mother

40
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:09,628
We'll let you know the
details later

41
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,229
Thank you

42
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,531
1

43
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,936
Shall we contact
his mother then?

44
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,907
I guess so

45
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,276
I'll leave that to
you, Ms Inoue

46
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,216
He said he was happy..

47
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:35,587
Katsutaro said he was
happy t eft Shota

48
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,356
told him how hef It

49
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,228
But I'm sure that's
not all he felt

50
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,974
I'll be able to
see Shota?

51
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,951
Thank you

52
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,688
So I'll be able to live
with Shota again.

53
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,692
We'll go over the details
on that day but..

54
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,394
This is just a step in
preparing for your new

55
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,363
life with Shota

56
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,768
Xi can't live together
after just meeting once

57
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,340
TFII have a number of
meetings before that

The meeting between Mikie
and Shota is the first

65
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,267
step in the preparation

66
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,603
All right. I'll see
you on Saturday then.

67
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,772
Thank you

68
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,974
Goodbye

69
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,744
Can you see him?

70
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,445
On Saturday.

71
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,914
What shall I wear?

72
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,183
You sound like you're
going out on a date

73
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,718
Can't you take off
from work fSda 7

74
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,020
I'm so relieved that
feel like going

75
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,922
out to eat something good.

76
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,157
1 can't! After all. I'm
the manager of the

77
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,693
branch in the Shinjuku
department store.

78
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,563
Manager? It's just a
little booth in the

79
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,431
basement level of the
department store

80
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,832
We sell a lot of
bento boxes

81
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,367
1

82
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,169
Depending on what day it
is, we sell even more

83
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,006
than the Akasaka restaurant
that my mom runs

84
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,509
Will your mom i e

85
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,577
I wonder..

86
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,880
I'd better go.

87
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,548
Are you leaving?

88
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,083
Thanks for the meal.

89
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,794
Department store basements
are great, aren't they?

90
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,596
You can sample a
lot of food

91
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,464
After we finish our sales
call, shall we stop by?

92
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,633
How can you be
so carefree?

93
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,802
3*~Bay, we're going
to get the account.

94
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,136

Thank you very much.

I found it!

102
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,255
Is Imasato in the department
store basement?

103
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,024
Imasato?

104
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,192
It's a Japanese restaurant
in Akasaka

105
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,861
It's quite known

106
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,131
I wonder if he's
the son

107
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,672
It's Saturday, the day
that Shota will be

108
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,874
meeting his mother

109
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,480
Are you leaving
already?

110
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,749
We didn't want to
keep her waiting.

111
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,951
sma? Let's go.

112
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,122
Be careful

114
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,828
Have fun, Shota.

115
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,865
I'm going now

116
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,568
We're leaving.

117
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,637
Thanks, Ume.

118
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,439
Don't worry

119
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,887
It's "ankoro mochi" nc e
wrapped in bean jam ,

120
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,124
I already opened it, but
one is enough for me

121
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,660
so you can have
the rest.

122
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,862
Thank you!

123
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,864
Thank you...

00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,366
Shall we 4eave some

125
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,169
Let's eat.

126
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,838
Thank you

127
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,374
Let's give one

129
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,461
His mother is here.

130
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,463
She is?

131
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,200
Inoue is talking
to her right now.

132
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,470
She's supposed to meet
with Shota after that

133
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,973
I hate to ask this, but
could you wait here

134
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,775
until the meeting is over?

135
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,348
Normally, the real parent
and the foster parent

136
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,550
don't have much
interaction

137
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,187
i e to avoid any
problem between them.

138
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,293
It won't be long now

139
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,097
When you see her, greet
her cheerfully.

140
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,269
Yes?

141
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,372
Shota. Your mother
is here.

142
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,319
Shota?

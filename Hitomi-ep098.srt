6
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:17,876
Yuka's father's company went
bankrupt last month

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,014
Didn't he have a number
of famous restaurants

8
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,784
Why didn't my dad or
my mom let me know?

9
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,254
They said your dad's
restaurants were

10
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,190
behind the times

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,495
A lot of fashionable
restaurants geared

12
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,064
for young people have
been opening up

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,167
Is that why the company
went out of business?

14
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,603
Your dad was so determined
to overcome it that he

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,438
opened more new
restaurants

16
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,310
He said he would show them
that he had what it took

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,980
But it was a mistake

18
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,784
I didn't know about
it until today

19
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,819
He told me not
to tell you.

20
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,489
He was ashamed to have
you see him like this

21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,625
so he even told me not to
tell you about this place

22
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,633
A long time ago, your dad
said that there were

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,304
stairs in this world, and
he was going up

24
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,108
those stairs. Climbing
higher and higher up

25
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,844
those stairs made him
so happy, and when he

26
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,713
let me work in the
restaurant, it made

27
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,681
me happy, too

28
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,851
I felt like I was climbing up
those stairs along with him.

29
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,956
While we doing that, neither
of us knew how we should

30
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:51,603
deal with you, so we just let
you do what you wanted.

31
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,242
When you said you were
going to quit ballet,

32
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,612
and try street dancing.

33
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,216
And when you said you wanted
money to rent a studio

34
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,618
We let you do what
you wanted

35
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:13,692
We cant do anything
for you anymore.

36
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,897
That's not what I
wanted to hear

37
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,627
Yuka...

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,505
I'm home.

39
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,543
Dad.

40
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,178
Yuka!

41
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,680
Hibino ol me

42
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,018
This is Hitomi. One of
her dance friends

43
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,254
Pleased to meet you.

44
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,993
Here

45
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,763
Dad

46
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,869
Let's talk, Dad

47
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,106
It's been a while since
we've seen each other...

48
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,441
Let's talk about what
you're going to do now

49
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,277
It has nothing to
do with you

50
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,113
Of course it does!
I'm your daughter!

51
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,421
What are you going
to do now?

52
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,790
Don't you have a
lot of debts7

53
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,894
Your mom and I will work,
and repay the debts.

54
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,195
How?

55
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,731
My friend is opening
a restaurant..

56
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,667
We'll work for him

57
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,268
We'll manage somehow.

58
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,338
That's how I got started
when I was young

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,308
Then I'll work,
and help out

60
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,476
Why would you?

61
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,612
I want to help!

62
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,818
Never mind. This is
our problem

63
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,587
What do vou mean
by "our" problem?

64
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,223
Aren't I a part of
this family, too?

65
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,193
You just do what
you want to do!

66
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,429
That's what we've let
you do all this time

67
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,100
She's such a troublesome
daughter

68
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,069
She started rebelling
against us since she

69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,304
got into high school

70
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,407
On top of that, she
ran away from home

71
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,711
We let her do whatever
she wanted to

72
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,146
We let her dance

73
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,483
We gave her as much money
as she asked ior

74
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,852
That's not what I wanted.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,555
Then what did you want?

76
00:05:58,991 --> 00:05:59,958
Yuka!

77
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,882


78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,657
He got what he deserves

79
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,030
All he t Blight about
is making money

80
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,335
So when the money is gone,
he has nothing left

81
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,238
Nothing at all

82
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,822
It was fun when
I was little...

83
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,560
Before my father started
his own business

84
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,532
He was a hired manager
for a restaurant.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,034
We lived in a condo about
the same size as the

86
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,203
one we saw today.

87
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:25,243
But on his days off, we used
to watch television together.

88
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,780
I used to like
Amuro Namie

89
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,416
So when I used to imitate
her and dance, he'd

90
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,819
laugh, and clap his hands

91
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,788
He told me how
good I was

92
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,690
He'd praise me

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,527
Mom used to smile a lot

94
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,066
It was fun back then.

95
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,974
But somewhere along the line,
something went wrong.

96
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,846
We turned into a family who
wouldn't even tell their

97
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,849
own daughter that something
this terrible happened.

98
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,218
YUka!

99
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm sorry..

100
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,722
I need to be alone
for a while

101
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,160
Let's talk about practice.

102
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,364
We're going to turn in
our entry tomorrow

103
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,600
You have it, don't
you, Hitomi7

104
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,072
Can you hold off for
a little while?

105
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,841
I can't think about
dancing right now

106
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,411
Don't say strange
things like that

107
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,914
I don't have time
to be dancing

108
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,149
That has nothing to do
with this, does it?

109
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,052
I just can't think about
dancing right now.

110
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,090
Listen here..

111
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,059
Why are you acting like
the spoiled little

112
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,828
rich girl now?

113
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,697
Didn't you say farewell
to that spoiled little

114
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,033
rich girl when you left that
mansion, and came here?

115
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,105
When I saw that,

116
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,108
I saw you in a new light..

117
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,377
I thought you had
a lot of spunk

118
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,380
jjij nv

119
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,048
3 M.
iHng e sailed

120
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,783
little rich girl again?

121
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,120
No matter what you say now,
you don't have a mansion

122
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,188
to go back to anymore

123
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,968
After living here with
you for 10 months and

124
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:38,276
dancing with you,
I had to admire you

125
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,218
We've urged each other on.

126
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,654
I thought we were friends
who would aim for the

127
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,656
o together

128
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,362

without you

129
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,198
igh *

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,902
e a e ROSE MARY unless
three i s are together

131
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,972
Then why don't you
change your name?

132
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,175
To ROSE TEA or
ROSE GARDEN ?

133
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,978
Get out

134
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,062
Hello..

135
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,531
Dad?

136
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,001
I'm fine

137
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,571
Why are you calling all
of a sudden?

138
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,140
What? Mom?

139
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,746
Okay.. I'll be
right there

140
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,415
What's wrong?

141
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,219
My mom got into an
auto accident

142
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,221
She was hit by a car

143
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,699
Utsunomiya...Are you
going there now?

144
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,535
I'm worried, so I thought
I'd go with her

145
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,505
I m sorry, but can
you make dinner?

146
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,374
All right,
I'll tell Dad

147
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,443
Thanks

148
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,745
Let's go, Hitomi.

149
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,647
Be sure to tell
Grandpa

150
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,849
Talk to you later.

151
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,219
Be careful

152
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,210
The two of them headed for
the hospital in Utsunomiya

153
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,380


154
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,317
Junko's parents run a small
gyoza restaurant here 

155
00:11:59,318 --> 00:11:59,651
in Utsunomiya

156
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,219
in Utsunomiya

157
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,257


158
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,592
Junko

159
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,793
How's Mom?

160
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,295
They're treating her now

161
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,963
It's not life-threatening

162
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,565
It's not?

163
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,769
Who's this?

164
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,604
My name is Hitomi.

165
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,107
I'm a friend of Junko's
from dance school.

166
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,642
She was worried, so
she came with me

167
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,478
You were

168
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,046
I'm Junko's father

169
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,015
What happened?

170
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,353
The car hit her on
the right side

171
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,722
Your mom came out from
the street suddenly

172
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,525
He hit his brakes, but he
couldn't avoid her

173
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,461
The driver is at the
police station now

174
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,531
So it was due to Mom's
carelessness7

175
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,767
So it seems.

176
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,604
She's used to walking
along that street

177
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,508
and it seems her mind
was on something else

178
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,209
She was thinking
about you

179
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,779
Oh, it's you

180
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,680
Mom was worried
about you

181
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,216
It's been almost a year
since you went to Tokyo,

182
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,619
but you haven't come out
on television yet

183
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,655
Keiichi.. Never mind
that. Say "hello"

184
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,924
to Hitomi, Junko's
friend from dance school

185
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,893
Pleased to meet you

186
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,162
I'm Junko's older
brother Keiichi

187
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,164
He works at a bank.

188
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,632
He's the eldest son, but
he's not going to take

189
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,966
over the restaurant

190
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,002
You sound so old-fashioned.

191
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,404
Rather than selling 300-yen
gyoza, I'm more suited

192
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,807
to moving 30 million yen
from right to left.

193
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,776
Are you a dancer too?

194
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,813
I'm surprised you want
to do something like that

195
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,681
You cant make
any money that way

196
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,251
Junko riled to or e s

197
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,320
but she quit, and went to
Tokyo to chase a dream

198
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,289
It will never come true

199
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,957
It's beyond her

200
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,827
Was Mom that worried
about me?

201
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,796
A iittle

202
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,167
It's not just that

203
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:01,573
With just your mom and me,
it's hard to increase our sales

204
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,342
And I can't push myself
like I did before

205
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,111


206
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,115
So if she got hurt because
she was thinking about

207
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,685
that, and not paying
attention, then

208
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,887
it's my fault that
she got hurt

209
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,536
Mr Hashimoto

210
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,972
We finished treating
her, but the doctor

211
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,040
wants to explain her
condition to you

212
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,442
i sctr

213
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,810
If you'll excuse us..

214
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,678
Will you wait here
for a while/

215
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,155
It looks like Junko has
family problems, too!

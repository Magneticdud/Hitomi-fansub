00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,014
idn't he have a nu 1)er
of famous t ^staurarits?

8
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,784
^Why didn't my dad or
my mom let me know9

9
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,254
They said your da 's
restaurants were

10
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,190
behind the times

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,495
A lot of ?ashionab h
restaurants geared

12
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,064
for young people have
been opening up

13
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,167
Is that why the co pan
weni ou. oi justness.

14
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,603
Your dad was Sb determined
to overcome it that he

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,438
opened more new
restaurants

16
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,310
He said he would show them
that he had what it took

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,980
But it was a istake

18
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,784
didn't Know about
t until today

19
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,819
He told me not
to tell you.

20
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,489
He was ashamed to have
you see him like this

21
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,625
so he even told me not to
tell you about this place

22
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,633
A long time ago, your dad
said that there were

23
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,304
stairs in this world, and

iQ was c imoing up

24
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,108
those stairs. Climbing
higher |mdtiigher up

25
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,844
those Stair? made him
so happy, and when he

26
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,713
let {network in the
restaurant, it made

27
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,681
me happy, too

28
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,851
I felt like I was climbing up
those stairs along with him.

29
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,956
While we doing that, neither
of knew how we should

30
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:51,603
deal with you, so we just let
you do what you wanted.

31
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,242
When you said you were
going to quit ballet,

32
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,612
and try street dancing.

33
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,216
And when you said you wanted
money to rent a studio

34
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,618
We let you do what
you wanted

35
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:13,692
e cant do anything
for you anymore.

36
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,897
That's not what
wanted to hear

37
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,627
Yuka...

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,505

Your mom and I will work,

54
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,195
How9

55
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,731
My friend is opening

Weil manage somehow.

58
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,338
That's how I got tarted
when j was young

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,308
Then i ll work,
and help out

60
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,476
Why would you9

61
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,612
want to help!

62
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,818
Nevermind. This is
our problem

63
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,587
What do vou mean
by "our'1 problem9

64
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,223
Aren't I a part of
this family, too9

65
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,193
You just do what
you want to do1

66
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,429
That's what we ve let
o II this time

67
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,100
She's such a troublesome
daughter

68
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,069
She started rebelling
against us since she

69
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,304
got into high school

70
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,407
On top of that, she
ran away from home

71
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,711
We let her do whatever
she wanted to

72
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,146
We let her dance

73
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,483
We gave her as much money
as she asked ior

74
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,852
That's not what I wanted.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,555
Then what did you want9

76
00:05:58,991 --> 00:05:59,958
Ytfka!

77
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,882



78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,657
He got what he deserves

79
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,030
All he t Blight about
aSmaking money

80
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:43,335
So enlhfe money is gone,
he has nothing left

81
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,238
No hing at all

82
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,822
It was fun when
I was little...

83
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,560
Before a er started
hiso nb iness

84
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,532
He was a hired manager
for a restaurant.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,034
We lived in a condo^bout
the same iz sthe

86
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,203
one we ven o today.

87
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:25,243
B t on his days off,Â«we used
to watch televisior together.

88
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,780
i used to like
Amuro amie

89
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,416
So when I used to imitate
her and dance, he'd be

90
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,819

91
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,788
He toid me how

92
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,690
He'd praise me

93
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,527
Mom used -o smile a lot

94
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,066
It was tun back then.

95
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,974
But somewhere along the line,
something went wrSfig.

96
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,846
We turned into a family who
wouldn't even tell their

97
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,849
own daughter that something
this terrible happened.

98

My name is Hitomi.

165
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,107
I'm a friend of Junko's

166
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,642
She as worried, so
she came with mfe

What happened?

170
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,353
The car hit her on

The driver is at the

174
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,531
So it was due to Mom's
carelessness7

175
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,767
So it seems.

176
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,604

00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:07,821
HITOMI

00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,013
CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 39

3
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,493
In order to get Yuka to join
their group in the audition,

4
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,762
Hitomi invited her
to Tsukishima.

5
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,814
It's kind of soothing, isn't it?

6
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,183
It has flavor.

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,422
It looks like Yuka likes it here.

8
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,533
Your house must be
awesome, Yuka.

9
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,168
It must be a mansion.

10
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,135
You're so lucky...

11
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,738
Your father runs a lot of
different restaurants.

12
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,707
A high-class Japanese
restaurant...

13
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,708
Japanese food...

14
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,176
A high-class shabu
shabu restaurant...

15
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,177
Shabu-shabu...

16
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,378
A high class Italian
restaurant...

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,546
Italian!

18
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,248
The KITA Dining Group is
in the gourmet guide, too.

19
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:18,187
Do you get to eat
all that for free?

20
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,022
Let's not talk
about my family.

21
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,727
I hate it... My parents both act
like they're such big celebrities.

22
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,270
Looks delicious.

23
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:37,973
It looks delicious!

24
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:40,943
It's delicious!

25
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:41,977
Is it?

26
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,748
Now I know what you meant about
the way it feels in your mouth, Moe.

27
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,050
The sliced squid is
delicious, too.

28
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,718
Sliced squid?

29
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,587
This?

30
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,955
I want to try it, too.

31
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,057
It's really good.
Delicious!

32
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,760
I'm glad you like it.

33
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,995
We have a lot of variety
on our menu.

34
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,765
Then the other day, he came up
with a "monja" Arabia...

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,467
It was my idea.
My name's Hiroshi.

36
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,336
Bring out the explanation.

37
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,838
We have a fun explanation
about the history of "monja".

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,174
Wait a minute!

39
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,643
We wanted to talk today...

40
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,111
You do?

41
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,713
What did you bring
that out here?

42
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,947
You told me to!

43
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,817
Junko!

44
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
Get to the point.

45
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,259
Yuka...

46
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,695
She's not listening.

47
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,297
No... she's listening.

48
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,567
I'm sorry about the
other day...

49
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:41,470
I just lost my temper...
I meant to apologize to you.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,677
I'll apologize, so don't you want to try
out for the audition with the two of us?

51
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:56,018
Your dancing is awesome, so Junko
and I really want to dance with you.

52
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,921
We need you to
win the audition.

53
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,190
Won't you dance
with us?

54
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:05,194
I don't know. It's not that I
absolutely don't want to do it, but...

55
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,196
Dancing alone suits
me better.

56
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,631
I'd like to try dancing
in a group, but...

57
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,835
It just doesn't
seem to work out.

58
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,383
After enjoying their "monja",
they went to explore the

59
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,253
town that still had a
nostalgic feel to it.

60
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,164
I'm home! I brought
my friends with me.

61
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:46,168
We've been waiting for you.

62
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,144
This is Yuka... Junko... and
Moe... This my grandpa.

63
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,613
Pleased to meet you.

64
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,781
Thank you for being
friends with Hitomi.

65
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,218
These are my children...
Akira... Yuria... Shota.

66
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,887
Hello...

67
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,289
They're the children
I told you about.

68
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,626
This is...

69
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:12,561
Hello...

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,497
These are our neighbors...
Yujiro and Ume.

71
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,066
Nice to meet you.

72
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,468
I'm Yuzo.

73
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,069
Sit down.

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,775
This is great. I've never
been in a house like this.

75
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:29,278
It's dirty, isn't it?

76
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:30,946
You should talk!

77
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,316
Is there a second floor?

78
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,286
There's a really old
laundry area, too.

79
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,488
I'd like to see it.

80
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:40,923
Do you want to go up?

81
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:41,723
Is it okay?

82
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:42,624
Sure!

83
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,592
Go ahead.

84
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,160
I think I will.

85
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,069
She seems to like our
house, doesn't she?

86
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,538
It's unusual to
a young gal.

87
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,673
Gal...?

88
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:00,075
She's from a rich family.

89
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,344
Her father is the president
of KITA Dining Group.

90
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,379
The one with the high-class
Japanese restaurant and

91
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,847
high class shabu shabu restaurant...?

92
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,382
They also have a high-class
Italian restaurant.

93
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,384
That's not bad.

94
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,687
We're a bonito flake wholesaler.

95
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,422
We make bonito flakes.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,360
This is Yuria's
and my room.

97
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,535
Nice breeze.

98
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,906
I give those kids credit.

99
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:34,109
They don't live with their
parents, but they're happy

100
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,978
and doing their best.

101
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,718
Right now, this
is their home.

102
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,527
This is nice.

103
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,296
Isn't it?

104
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:03,772
You're getting in the way.

105
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,641
The Chinese cabbage is ready.

106
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,943
Here you go young lady.

107
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,145
We have our own pot here.

108
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,413
Don't worry...

109
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:19,855
Young lady... Your father
is really great, isn't he?

110
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,291
I respect a man like that.

111
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,726
Opening so many restaurants.
He's really something.

112
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,061
And every one of those
restaurants come out

113
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,863
in the gourmet magazines.

114
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,232
I think your honorable
father is great.

115
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,134
Let's not talk
about my father.

116
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,337
She's right. She doesn't want
to talk about him, so stop it.

117
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:36,605
She's being modest.

118
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,473
The young lady's just
being modest.

119
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,342
This is when we need to push.

120
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,477
What do you mean by that?

121
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:44,646
Never mind. This is
between adults.

122
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:48,617
Young lady...? In such a
high class restaurant as

123
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:52,621
that, they must use really
good quality bonito flakes...

124
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:57,859
Our bonito flakes are really
good quality, too.

125
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,263
Don't you agree?

126
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:04,599
We have old, traditional
restaurants in Ginza and

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,235
Nihonbashi that buy
from us all the time.

128
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,006
Don't you think it's in
bad taste to talk about

129
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,607
business at a time
like this?

130
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,277
He's right. Rubbing your hands
together like that, too.

131
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,412
When it comes to the daughter
of someone that important,

132
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,582
I'm so humbled, I just rub my hands
together without even thinking about it.

133
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,884
Young lady...! Please
don't look at him..

134
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,653
I'd like you to
look at me.

135
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:30,325
If you could just mention
it your honorable father,

136
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,795
and see if he would like
to sample our product...

137
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,630
I told you to stop...

138
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,132
Excuse me!

139
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,266
I'm leaving!

140
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:39,568
Yuka... ?

141
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,470
I'm sorry, Hitomi...
I don't feel well.

142
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,338
I'm sorry, everybody.

143
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,673
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,941
Thank you for the meal.

145
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,242
Yuka! Wait!

146
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,276
Yuka!

147
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:52,514
Did I say something wrong?

148
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,450
Look at what you did! You
upset the young lady.

149
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,387
Did you hear what you said?
You sounded just like

150
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,455
a samurai humbling himself
before his lord.

151
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,390
You idiot!

152
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,125
What did you mean by
"time to push"?

153
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,426
Never mind. It's for
adults only.

154
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,794
Tell her what it means!

155
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,064
Yuka!

156
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,900
I hate people who call
me "young lady".

157
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,635
People like that aren't
looking at me...

158
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,237
They're seeing my dad.

159
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,773
I think I understand
how you feel, but...

160
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,541
Up until now, there have
been a lot of kids who

161
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,376
tried to make friends with
me, thinking that they

162
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,378
could get something
out of it.

163
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,813
We're not like that.

164
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,581
We want to be with you.

165
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:32,487
I'm sorry. I'm going home.

166
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:36,057
Yuka!

167
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,359
Yuka...?

168
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:47,969
I'm hungry...

169
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,039
Here they come...

170
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,213
Hitomi...

171
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:00,782
What happened to
the young lady?

172
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:01,817
She went home.

173
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,151
Did we make her angry...?

174
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,353
Talking about her father
and his business...

175
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,056
That might have had something
to do with it...

176
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,090
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,560
I know you were trying to
get to know each other...

178
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,094
You're angry, aren't
you, Hitomi?

179
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,796
Not at all. I'm not angry.

180
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,231
I'm not angry at all.

181
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,333
You sound a little sharp.

182
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,669
You're all upset,
aren't you?

183
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,637
Not at all...

184
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,606
No... We're not, so don't
let it bother you.

185
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,074
I see...

186
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,442
Let's go finish
our pot stew...

187
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,211
They're not angry...

188
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,979
I'm glad. Let's eat, too.

189
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,684
The door's locked.

190
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
It's Ishida...

191
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:45,627
The next day...

192
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:48,129
She's here!

193
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:57,539
Shall we go?

194
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,176
Yuka!

195
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,745
Were you lying in
wait for me?

196
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,413
We need you to
dance with us.

197
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,182
Without you, we can't
win the audition.

198
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:10,585
Just try it once... See how the
three of us dance together.

199
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,687
We already have some
of it choreographed.

200
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,456
I've reserved a studio to
practice at from today

201
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:16,024
until the audition.

202
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,226
I'm going to practice
there by myself.

203
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,628
You two do your best.

204
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:21,796
Pick me up at four.

205
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,666
Yuka!

206
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,044
She turned us down
flat, didn't she?

207
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,014
What are you going to do?

208
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,683
Shall we do it with just
the two of us then?

209
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,329
After Yuka turned them down,
Junko and Hitomi got down

210
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,933
to practicing for the
audition seriously.

211
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:07,108
In hip hop dancing, you build
on the basic steps available,

212
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:10,545
adding steps and movements
that reflect the dancers'

213
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:13,481
individuality. and enhance
the group's ambience.

214
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,720
When you get a good idea, you
write it down right away.

215
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,690
Solidifying your movements
a little at a time.

216
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,596
It's also important to build
up your muscles, so you can

217
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:30,799
move just the way you
picture the dance moves.

218
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,208
Once you have the whole
dance choreographed, you

219
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,912
practice it over and over again, so
your body will remember each move.

220
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,751
When dancing in a group, it's
important to have teamwork.

221
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,487
You keep practicing until
you get your timing to

222
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,957
match, and once you have that,
then your dance is complete.

223
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,899
From three days before the
audition, Hitomi left the

224
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,103
meal preparations to Katsutaro
and the children, so she

225
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,904
would have more time
to practice.

226
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,884
What do you think?

227
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,020
Do you think we look good?

228
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:29,124
We do, but then again
maybe not.

229
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,326
What do you think, Moe?

230
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,131
It's not explosive enough.

231
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,866
You seem to be
holding back.

232
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,634
You two can do better.

233
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,202
What are we supposed to do?

234
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,504
The audition is tomorrow.

235
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,739
Put more of yourself
into your dancing.

236
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,008
We learned in diet class
to listen carefully to

237
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,411
the music, and dance
more like you.

238
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,880
You mean go back
to your roots?

239
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,115
But how are we going
to do that?

240
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:57,585
Junko... You have to think
"I'm hot! I'm going to

241
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,022
make my major debut, and go
back home in a blaze of glory!"

242
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:02,557
What about me?

243
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:06,895
You just think, "I'm huge! I'm throwing
the balance off but I don't care!"

244
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:08,496
I'm hot!

245
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:09,698
I'm huge!

246
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,734
Shall we show them
some attitude?

247
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:14,436
Ok. Let's do it.

248
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,085
Since coming to Tokyo, this
will be her first real

249
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:33,521
audition, and Hitomi is going
to give it all she's got.

250
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,040
The audition is tomorrow.

251
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
To be continued...

CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 39

2
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,643
In order to get Yuka to join
their group in the audition,

3
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,912
Hitomi invited her
toTsukishima.

4
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,964
It's kind of soothing, isn't it?

5
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,333
It has flavor.

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,572
It looks like Yuka likes it here.

7
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,683
Your house must be
awesome, Yuka.

8
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,318
It must be a mansion.

9
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,285
You're so lucky...

10
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,888
Your father runs a lot of
different restaurants.

11
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,857
A high-class Japanese
restaurant...

12
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,858
Japanese food...

13
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,326
A high-class shabu
shabu restaurant...

14
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,327
Shabu-shabu...

15
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,528
A high class Italian
restaurant...

16
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,696
Italian!

17
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,398
The KITA Dining Group is
in the gourmet guide, too.

18
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,337
Do you get to eat
all that for free?

19
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,172
Let's not talk
about my family.

20
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,975
I hate it... My parents
both act like they're

21
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,877
such big celebrities.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,420
Looks delicious.

23
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,123
It looks delicious!

24
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,093
It's delicious!

25
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,127
Is it?

26
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,229
Now I know what you meant
about the way it feels

27
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,898
in your mouth, Moe.

28
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,200
The sliced squid is
delicious, too.

29
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,868
Sliced squid?

30
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,737
This?

31
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,105
I want to try it, too.

32
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,207
It's really good.
Delicious!

33
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,910
I'm glad you like it.

34
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,145
We have a lot of variety
on our menu.

35
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,915
The the other day. he came up
with a "monja" Arabia...

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,617
It was my idea.
My name's Hiroshi.

37
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,486
Bring out the explanation.

38
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,988
We have a fun explanation
about the history of "monja".

39
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,324
Wait a minute!

40
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,793
We wanted to talk today...

41
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,261
You do?

42
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,863
What did you bring
that out here?

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,097
You told me to!

44
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:21,967
Junko!

45
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,937
Get to the point.

46
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,409
Yuka...

47
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,845
She's not listening.

48
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,447
No... she's listening.

49
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,717
I'm sorry about the
other day...

50
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,620
I just lost my temper...
I meant to apologize to you.

51
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,592
I'll apologize, so don't you
want to try out for the

52
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,827
audition with the two of us?

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,333
Your dancing is awesome,
so Junko and I really

54
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,168
want to dance with you.

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,071
We need you to
win the audition.

56
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,340
Won't you dance
with us?

57
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,842
I don't know. It's not that
I absolutely don't want

58
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,344
to do it, but...

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,346
Dancing alone suits
me better.

60
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,781
I'd like to try dancing
in a group, but...

61
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,985
It just doesn't
seem to work out.

62
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,533
After enjoying their "monja",
they went to explore the

63
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,403
town that still had a
nostalgic feel to it.

64
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,314
I'm home! I brought
my friends with me.

65
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,318
We've been waiting for you.

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,294
This is Yuka... Junko... and
Moe... This my grandpa.

67
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,763
Pleased to meet you.

68
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,931
Thank you for being
friends with Hitomi.

69
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,368
These are my children...
Akira... Yuria... Shota.

70
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,037
Hello...

71
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,439
They're the children
I told you about.

72
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,776
This is...

73
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,711
Hello...

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,647
These are our neighbors...
Yujiro and Ume.

75
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,216
Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,618
I'm Yuzo.

77
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,219
Sit down.

78
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,925
This is great. I've never
been in a house like this.

79
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,428
It's dirty, isn't it?

80
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,096
You should talk!

81
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,466
Is there a second floor?

82
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,436
There's a really old
laundry area, too.

83
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,638
I'd like to see it.

84
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,073
Do you want to go up?

85
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:41,873
Is it okay?

86
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:42,774
Sure!

87
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,742
Go ahead.

88
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,310
I think I will.

89
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,219
She seems to like our
house, doesn't she?

90
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,688
It's unusual to
a young gal.

91
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:57,823
Gal...?

92
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,225
She's from a rich family.

93
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,494
Her father is the president
of KITA Dining Group.

94
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,529
The one with the high-class
Japanese restaurant and

95
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,997
high class shabu shabu restaurant...?

96
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,532
They also have a high-class
Italian restaurant.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,534
That's not bad.

98
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,837
We're a bonito flake wholesaler.

99
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,572
We make bonito flakes.

100
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,510
This is Yuria's
and my room.

101
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,685
Nice breeze.

102
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,056
I give those kids credit.

103
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,259
They don't live with their
parents, but they're happy

104
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,128
and doing their best.

105
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,868
Right now, this
is their home.

106
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,677
This is nice.

107
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,446
Isn't it?

108
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,922
You're getting in the way.

109
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,791
The Chinese cabbage is ready.

110
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,093
Here you go young lady.

111
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,295
We have our own pot here.

112
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,563
Don't worry...

113
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,005
Young lady... Your father
is really great, isn't he?

114
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,441
I respect a man like that.

115
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,876
Opening so many restaurants.
He's really something.

116
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,211
And every one of those
restaurants come out

117
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,013
in the gourmet magazines.

118
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,382
I think your honorable
father is great.

119
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,284
Let's not talk
about my father.

120
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,386
She's right. She doesn't
want to talk about him,

121
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,487
so stop it.

122
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,755
She's being modest.

123
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,623
The young lady's just
being modest.

124
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,492
This is when we need to push.

125
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,627
What do you mean by that?

126
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,796
Never mind. This is
between adults.

127
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,767
Young lady...? In such a
high class restaurant as

128
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,771
that, they must use really
good quality bonito flakes...

129
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:58,009
Our bonito flakes are really
good quality, too.

130
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,413
Don't you agree?

131
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,749
We have old, traditional
restaurants in Ginza and

132
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,385
Nihonbashi that buy
from us ail the time.

133
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,156
Don't you think it's in
bad taste to talk about

134
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,757
business at a time
like this?

135
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,427
He's right. Rubbing your hands
together like that, too.

136
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,562
When it comes to the daughter
of someone that important,

137
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,598
I'm so humbled, I just rub
my hands together without

138
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,732
even thinking about it.

139
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,034
Young lady...! Please
don't look at him..

140
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,803
I'd like you to
look at me.

141
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,475
If you could just mention
it your honorable father,

142
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,945
and see if he would like
to sample our product...

143
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,780
I told you to stop...

144
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,282
Excuse me!

145
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,416
I'm leaving!

146
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:39,718
Yuka... ?

147
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm sorry, Hitomi...
I don't feel well.

148
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,488
I'm sorry, everybody.

149
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,823
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,091
Thank you for the meal.

151
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,392
Yuka! Wait!

152
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,426
Yuka!

153
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,664
Did I say something wrong?

154
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,600
Look at what you did! You
upset the young lady.

155
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,537
Did you hear what you said?
You sounded just like

156
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,605
a samurai humbling himself
before his lord.

157
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,540
You idiot!

158
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,275
What did you mean by
"time to push"?

159
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,576
Never mind. It's for
adults only.

160
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,944
Tell her what it means!

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,214
Yuka!

162
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,050
I hate people who call
me "young lady".

163
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,785
People like that aren't
looking at me...

164
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,387
They're seeing my dad.

165
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,923
I think I understand
how you feel, but...

166
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,691
Up until now, there have
been a lot of kids who

167
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,526
tried to make friends with
me, thinking that they

168
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,528
could get something
out of it.

169
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,963
We're not like that.

170
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,731
We want to be with you.

171
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:32,637
I'm sorry. I'm going home.

172
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,207
Yuka!

173
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,509
Yuka...?

174
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,119
I'm hungry...

175
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,189
Here they come...

176
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,363
Hitomi...

177
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,932
What happened to
the young lady?

178
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,967
She went home.

179
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,301
Did we make her angry...?

180
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,503
Talking about her father
and his business...

181
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,206
That might have had something
to do with it...

182
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,710
I know you were trying to
get to know each other...

184
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,244
You're angry, aren't
you, Hitomi?

185
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,946
Not at all. I'm not angry.

186
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,381
I'm not angry at all.

187
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,483
You sound a little sharp.

188
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,819
You're all upset,
aren't you?

189
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,787
Not at all...

190
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,756
No... We're not, so don't
let it bother you.

191
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,224
I see...

192
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,592
Let's go finish
our pot stew...

193
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,361
They're not angry...

194
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,129
I'm glad. Let's eat, too.

195
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,834
The door's locked.

196
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,770
It's Ishida...

197
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,777
The next day...

198
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,279
She's here!

199
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,689
Shall we go?

200
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,326
Yuka!

201
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,895
Were you lying in
wait for me?

202
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,563
We need you to
dance with us.

203
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,332
Without you, we can't
win the audition.

204
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,735
Just try it once... See how the
three of us dance together.

205
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,837
We already have some
of it choreographed.

206
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,606
I've reserved a studio to
practice at from today

207
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,174
until the audition.

208
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,376
I'm going to practice
there by myself.

209
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,778
You two do your best.

210
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,946
Pick me up at four.

211
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,816
Yuka!

212
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,194
She turned us down
flat, didn't she?

213
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,164
What are you going to do?

214
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,833
Shall we do it with just
the two of us then?

215
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,479
After Yuka turned them down,
Junko and Hitomi got down

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,083
to practicing for the
audition seriously.

217
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,258
In hip hop dancing, you build
on the basic steps available,

218
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,695
adding steps and movements
that reflect the dancers'

219
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,631
individuality. and enhance
the group's ambience.

220
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,870
When you get a good idea, you
write it down right away.

221
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,840
Solidifying your movements
a little at a time.

222
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,746
It's also important to build
up your muscles, so you can

223
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,949
move just the way you
picture the dance moves.

224
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,358
Once you have the whole
dance choreographed, you

225
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,260
practice it over and over
again, so your body will

226
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,062
remember each move.

227
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,901
When dancing in a group, it's
important to have teamwork.

228
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,637
You keep practicing until
you get your timing to

229
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,107
match, and once you have that,
then your dance is complete.

230
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,049
From three days before the
audition, Hitomi left the

231
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,253
meal preparations to Katsutaro
and the children, so she

232
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,054
would have more time
to practice.

233
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,034
What do you think?

234
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,170
Do you think we look good?

235
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,274
We do, but then again
maybe not.

236
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,476
What do you think, Moe?

237
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,281
It's not explosive enough.

238
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,016
You seem to be
holding back.

239
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,784
You two can do better.

240
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,352
What are we supposed to do?

241
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,654
The audition is tomorrow.

242
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,889
Put more of yourself
into your dancing.

243
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,158
We learned in diet class
to listen carefully to

244
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,561
the music, and dance
more like you.

245
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,030
You mean go back
to your roots?

246
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,265
But how are we going
to do that?

247
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,735
Junko... You have to think
"I'm hot! I'm going to

248
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,172
make my major debut, and go
back home in a blaze of glory!"

249
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,707
What about me?

250
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,909
You just think, "I'm huge!
I'm throwing the balance

251
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,045
off but I don't care!"

252
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,646
I'm hot!

253
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,848
I'm huge!

254
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,884
Shall we show them
some attitude?

255
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,586
Ok. Let's do it.

256
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,235
Since coming to Tokyo, this
will be her first real

257
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,671
audition, and Hitomi is going
to give it all she's got.

258
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,190
The audition is tomorrow.

259
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,190
To be continued...

then your dance is complete.

233
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,049
From three days before the
audition, Hitomi left the

234
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,253
meal preparations to Katsutaro
and the children, so s

235
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,054
would have more lime
to practice

236
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,034
What do you think9

237
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,170
Do you think we look good?

00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,476
What do you think, Moe?

240
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,281

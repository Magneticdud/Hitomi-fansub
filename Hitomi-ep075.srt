42
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,389
I asked Akira..

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,657
What did you ask?

00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,122
So dancing is
one of them...

56
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,857
She really seems
to love it

57
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,225

Are you in between
sales calls?

90
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,027
I'm on my way back from
a department store.

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,862
As usual, it didn't
go very well, so

92
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,697
I'm not too anxious to go
back to the office

93
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,432
That's why I made
a little detour

94
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,034
You're having a hard
time, aren't you?

95
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,168
What about you?

96
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,570
Is it going smoothly?

97
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,773
I can't say it's going
jjiojtll*

98
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,576
1 think we're
getting there.

99
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,780
You think so? if you win
the 500.000 yen. -reaX me

100
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,448
you're going to split
the prize, aren't you?

101
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,784
Which means, you'll each
get 125,000 yen.

102
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,119
Don't say that..

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,987
I'm trying not to
think about that

104
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,889
You're such a wimp.

105
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,193
I went to visit your grandpa
at the hospital

106
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,696
You did?

107
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,334
He was flirting with the nurse
even while I was there.

108
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,202
I didn't want to start
fighting with him, so

109
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,737
I left right away.

110
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,607
He was just embarrassed

It's really good

Okonomiyaki is good, too.

But I prefer monja

176
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,134
It has depth when
you bite into it

177
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,169
Okonomiyaki is a little

Hiro! Isn't XU'\ enough?
It's ready, isn't it?

184
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,150
I guess it is

185
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,085
Go ahead and eat it.

186
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,487
Use the spatula

187
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,324

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,796
I don't feel like
eating it

191
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,798
We're leaving

192
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,435
We'll leave the
money

193
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,639
What is this "monja"
anyway?

194
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,041
It's ridiculous

195
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,475
It's something
you eat

196
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,848
Who are you?

197
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,417
Hitomi

198
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,852
You're being rude to the
people who run this place

199
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,554
How arp you come to a
monja restaurant,

200
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,923
insult monja, and leave
without even eating it!

201
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,525
It's up to the customer,
isn't it?

202
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,293
That's not the problem

203
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,663
You're insulting the
people who make it.

204
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,298
Haven't you heard the
saying. "When in Rome,

205
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,733
do as the Romans do."

206
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,035
You should learn to
keep your month shut!

207
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,004
How dare you come to
Tsukishima, and

208
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,505
insult "monja."

209
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,509
I wouldn't go to Osaka and
insult "okonomiyaki"

211
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,046
Whether it's "monja" or
"okonomiyaki" you

212
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,082
should just sit down
and enjoy it.

213
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,316
Shut up!

00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,884

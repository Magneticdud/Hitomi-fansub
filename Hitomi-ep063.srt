The next day...

134

Katsutaro's surgery
has already begun.

135
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,981
Even if they said it's
a simple operation,

136
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,816
I'm still worried

137
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,051

He's still in the

142
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,508
Whenlt's over, say a
few nice words to him

143
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,711
It's probably reallf
hard on him.

I said... he surgery
didn't take that long.

153
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,446
Did it hurt?

154
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,482
all.

155
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,118
It was a major operation
with a number of doctors

156
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,953
working on you, wasn't it?

157
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,622
There was only one doctor.

158
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,993
He just opened the knee,
—and seweb it right back

159
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,729
up again... What are you
talking about anyway?

160
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,899
t's probably d's
easiest operation.

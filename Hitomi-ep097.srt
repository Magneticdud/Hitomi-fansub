At the start of the new year

00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,732
The Ippongi family began their
life without Shota..

it's a collaboration,
isn't it?

16
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,844
That's exactly
what it is.

17
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,680
The family of five is now
a family of four

18
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:51,770
Once in a while, they
felt lonely, but they

19
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,540
didn't have much
time for that.

20
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,209
Entrance exam day!

21
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,791
Life went on for
the family

22
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,058
Life went on for
the family

February 2008

It's February..
February, 2008

00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,178

26
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:46,225
This month is the anniversary
of Mom's..Setsuko's death.

27
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,527
Then that means that it's
been a year since I came

28
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,895
to live here, doesn't it?

29
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,029
That's right.

30
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,733
We were so surprised when
we first met you.

31
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,401
You were so big.

32
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,469
That's right.

33
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,374
Wait a minute!

34
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,310
On my way home from
the funeral, I was

35
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,447
r~YisÂ£d hen! a were
dancing like this...

36
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,319
It was just about the time
that they were iSing the

37
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,455
preliminaries Dance
Beat in Sapporo...

38
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,925
I was supposed to be in
it, but I couldn't...

39
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,262
We're going to
quit dancing.

40
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,696
Wait a minute!

41
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,498
The preliminaries are the
day after tomorrow!

42
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,934
If you look at it realistically,
being normal is be m

43
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,903
I was supposed to dance
with two other girls,

44
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,973
but when they thought
about the future

45
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,509
they decided to look for
full-time jobs instead

46
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,113
But I couldn't give it up

47
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,785
I'm glad your group
broke up

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,054
Why?

49
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,223
Because, if they
hadn't broken up, Hitomi

50
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,091
wouldn't have come to
live here, would she?

51
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,794
That's right.

52
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,697
Last year, around this time,
I never imagined I would

53
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,134
be sitting here eating dinner
with the two of you

54
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,106
But now, we can't imagine
not having you here with

55
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,608
us, can we?

56
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,878
That's true.

57
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,386

MOBO

104
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,144
What about a leader?

105
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,379
Leader?

106
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,281
It should be Yuka

107
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,949
M * Y do it, ufikt)

108
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,419
Because... you like to
stan lit, don't you?

109
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,189
When we do interviews, you
can do all the talking.

110
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,191
I don't really like to talk.

111
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,425
Really?

112
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,829
What does the leader
do anyway?

113
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,633
To put it simply, someone who
keeps everything together.

114
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,502
Then it should be Hitomi.

115
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,503
Hitomi!

116
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,771
Why me?

117
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,206
Because

118
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,075
You're the one who holds everything
together, aren't you?

119
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,176
That's right.

120
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,378
When Junko and I start
fighting, you can

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,712
keep things together.

122
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,347
Really?

123
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,516
I vote for you
too, Hitomi

124
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,790
OK, I'll do it

125
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,358
That's it then.

126
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,530
Can I have this picture
of the four of us?

127
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,599
That one's out
of focus

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,367
It's OK.

129
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,038
The leader treats everyone
once in a while, right?

130
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,072
That's right

131
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,707
You can treat us
to monja

132
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,809
OK! We're counting
on you, Leader

133
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,179
You're going to be
the leader?

134
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,582
That's awesome, Hitomi

135
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,953

How is it going?

142

Are you confident?

143
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,074
It's not that I don't
have any confidence

144
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,442
He's confident

145
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,510
I didn't say that

146
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,546
You scored Tu~h on the
mock exams, didn't you?

147

183
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:19,170
Yuka's father's company
went bankrupt last month.

184
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,809
idnl he ve a mb
f famous restaurants? .I

185
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,880
Why didn't my dad or
my mom let me know?

186
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:33,017
I thought your parents
had told you about it

187
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,854
So I came to say
goodbye today

188
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,489

I'm going with her

192
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,399
What a shock!

193
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,735

196
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,581
Hitomi and Yuka were headed
for the place where Yuka's

197
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,350
parents had moved

198
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,955

202
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,206
Mom!

203
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,843
How did this "happen?

204
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,616
It used to be popular
before but for the

205
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,553
past two or three years.

206
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,972
They said your dad's
restaurants were

207
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,974
behind the times

208
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,680
A lot of fashionable
restaurants geared

209
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,316
for young people have
been opening up

210
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,585
Is that why the company
went out of business?

211
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,590
It wasn't only that

212
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,926
Your dad was so determined
to overcome it that he

213
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,028
opened more new
restaurants

214
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,334
He said he would show them
that he had what it took

215
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,037
But it was a mistake

216
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,407
I didn't know about
it until today

217
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,710
If Hibino hadnt toid me,
I wouldn't have ever

218
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,278
known about it.

219
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,814
He told me not
to tell you

220
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,617
He was ashamed to have
you see him like this

221
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,953
so he even told me not to
tell you about this place

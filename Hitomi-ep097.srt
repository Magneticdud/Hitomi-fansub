o did this "happen?

204
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,616
It used to be popular
before Jbut for the

205
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,553
past two orjhree years.

206
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,972
They sa fl your da 's
restaurants were

207
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,974
behind the times

208
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,680
A lot of fashionable
restaurants geared

209
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,316
for young people have
been ooening up

210
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,585
Is that whylhe compan
went out of business9

211
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,590
It wasn't only that

212
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,926
Your dad was so determined
to overcome it that he

213
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,028
opened more new
restaurants

214
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,334
He said he would show them
that he had what it took

215
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,037
But it was a mistake

216
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,407
didn't know about
It until today

217
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,710
If Hibino hadnt toid me,
! wouldn't have even

218
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,278
known about it.

219
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,814
He told me not
to tell you

220
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,617
He was ashamed to have
you see him like this

221
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,953
so he even toid me not to
tell you about this place

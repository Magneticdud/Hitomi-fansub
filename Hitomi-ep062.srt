CHAPTER 11
Summer Without Grandpa
Episode 62

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,692
Grandpa fell down
the stairs?

3
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,596
Katsutaro had a broken knee
after falling down the

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,365
stairs in his store, so he
was going to be in the

5
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,534
hospital for about a month

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,976
I thought you'd be hungry
Go ahead and eat

7
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,011
Thank you

8
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,982
Listen, everybody

9
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,751
What's up, Dad?

10
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,721
Akira, Yuria and Shota.

11
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,726
You're the children of
this tenement here.

12
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,828
Isn't that right?

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,666
So while Katsu's gone
for a month, I thought

14
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,236
we could all help
Katsu's family

15
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,704
What do you think?

16
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,472
Excuse me

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,308
When I overworked myself
Vf
e asi time an

18
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,778
collapsed, I realized that
if I let stubborn pride

19
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,249
get in the way, I only
inconvenience everybody.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,719
So this time, Please let me
rely on everyone's help...

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,254
Please help me out.

22
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,322
Please help us.

23
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,827
We're neighbors
aren't we?

24
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,731
I'll do anything
I can do to help.

25
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,566
I will, too

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,069
Whenever I have time,
I'll stop by here.

27
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,539
Thank you

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,376
Let's all discuss what
we can do to help

29
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,012
What about the
store, Yu?

30
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,147
Thats true...If it's
closed for a month,

31
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,550
he'll lose money,
6aij I.UOM

32
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,219
That's what I thought, so
before I left, I asked

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,787
Katsu about it

34
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,556
If he wanted to keep the
store open, I'm willing

35
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,424
to watch the store for him

36
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,293
What did Dad say?

37
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,994
He said he would feel
bad, and he didn't

38
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,863
want to me to overdo it

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,532
But he really wants
to keep it open.

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,101
Dad was proud of the fact
that he never closed

41
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,304
He said the customers made
time in their busy schedules

42
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,940
to come to the store, so it
was his job to stay there

43
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,008
and wait for them to come

44
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,582
What is it? Go ahead,
and say it

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,020
Why don't we just decide
to keep it open then?

46
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,856
I'll watch the store

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,326
When I'm watching the
store people buy

48
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,294
a lot of shirts

49
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,832
But we can't have you watch
the store all day long

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,372
Why don't we take turns?

51
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,774
Whoever has the time
can come and do it.

52
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,310
That's an idea

53
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,879
Why don't we do this then?

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,448
Let's make up
a schedule

55
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,916
Schedule?

56
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,518
We'll figure out what has to
be done at home and at

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,422
the store, and make up a
schedule of who can help.

58
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,759
We'll decide who can
do what and when

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,394
We'll divide up the work

60
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,929
That's a good idea

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,465
Let's draw up a schedule
for a whole day then.

62
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,966
Let's do it

63
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,468
You can be the "shoki."

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,203
What's a "shoki"?

65
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,471
Don't you konw what
a "shoki" is?

66
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,639
A cup or a bowl?

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,340
That's "shokki' (dishes).

68
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,808
You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

69
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,212
Of course! I don't want to
be a "shoki" (secretary)

70
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,582
I'm the chairman, and
you're the secretary

71
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,452
All right. I'll do it
I'll be right back.

72
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,922
What is he doing?

73
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,261
Let's start with morning.

74
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,398
ere i you gei
ITat. Yu 1>?

75
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,835
Don't get hung up on
details, **.

76
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,205
Let's get back to this..
What about the mornings?

77
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,408
In the morning, it's just
breakfast and the laundry,

78
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,843
so the children and I can
do that by ourselves.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,745
When I'm on the night shift,
I'll come by to help when

80
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,780
I get off work.

81
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,981
That would help a lot.

82
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,684
After breakfast, you have
to go to your part-time

83
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,452
job, don't you, Hitomi?

84
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,920
that's right. So the
children will be alone

85
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,722
after I leave...

86
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,791
It's summer vacation,
isn't it?

87
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,326
I'll study in the morning.

88
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,696
I can look over their
homework for them.

89
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,564
We should do it downstairs,
so rio one can come in,

90
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,099
lid r t) the^place

91
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,600
Shall we do that then?

92
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,303
Do your studying downstairs
in the morning

93
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,839
Yuzo - you're not
keeping up

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,407
Hurry, and write it down.

95
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,677
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

96
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,379
All right?

97
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,416
Ne lis the store.

98
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,952
He opens at 10 o'clock.

99
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,555
I'll come right before that,
and open the store

100
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,724
We have to take out the
things on the wagon.

101
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,227
After I help out with that,
I'll go to tutorial school

102
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,729
You're going to take
entrance exams next year

103
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,663
aren't you?

104
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,064
We'll go to the pool

105
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,234
After I see them off,
I'll watch the store.

106
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,503
What time do they come
home from the pool?

107
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,971
1:30...

108
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,774
You have to eat lunch,
don't you?

109
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,242
On my way back from buying
my supplies, I'll bring

110
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,777
something by for you

111
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,313
I can make something, and
bring it over, too

112
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,116
I'll make extra rice
in the morning

113
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,018
Hurry, write
that down

114
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,454
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

115
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,356
I'm writing

116
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,325
Tie's going to cook
extra rice, and

117
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,993
Ume and Mari will
bring lunch

118
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:39,531
So that takes care of the
morning, doesn't it?

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,900
What about
the afternoon?

120
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,935
We have to go
and visit Dad

121
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,737
I can bring him a change
of clothes everyday

122
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,873
after my part time job
Before I go to school.

123
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,142
I'll stop by to see him
after my tutorial school

124
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,243
I have supplementary
lessons sometimes

125
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,578
and days won't always
be the same.

126
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,813
What about us?

127
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,883
I'd like to take you,
but it depends how

128
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,684
busy our shop is

129
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,254
What about you, Mari?

130
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,459
I have shamisen lessons
in the afternoon

131
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,862
Are you learning to
play the shamisen?

132
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,297
Idiot! She's teaching it

133
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,932
She's a master (shihan)

134
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,601
That's right! It's been a
quarter of a century

135
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,304
(SHIHAN seiki) since she started
started playing the shamisen

136
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,008
Depending on my shift,
I think I can make it

137
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,509
~t\$o days a week

138
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,545
Just as we expect
from you, Keiko.

139
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,147
The rest of the days,
I'll take you.

140
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,550
I'll leave the work
to Yuzo.

141
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,553
Just as we expect
from Uncle Yujiro

142
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:35,987
Wait a minute

143
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,356
You can't do that. You have
to take care of the books.

144
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,992
What is it?

145
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,896
What do vou want?

146
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,167
All right. After I take
the children, I'll come

147
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,436
back to Tsukiji, and
do the books

148
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,472
That's great

149
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,647
About watching the store...

150
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,419
The way we have it now,
Ume's watching the

151
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,187
store all day long.

152
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,089
You're right.

153
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,358
There's something
I want to watch.

154
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,626
What?

155
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,762
The repeat broadcast of
a historical drama

156
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,167
But, I guess I could stand
not seeing it if

157
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,835
that'll help..

158
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,338
No, no #11

159
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,006
You should watch it

160
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,941
It's all you have to
look forward to.

161
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,778
I'll take the kids to the
hospital, go back

162
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,282
to Tsukiji to do the books,
and come back here..

163
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,451
That would be about 2:30,
and I'll take over for

164
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,887
Ume, and watch the store

165
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,389
Just what you'd expect
from Yujiro.

166
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,558
Give Yujiro a hand

167
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,194
Thank you.. Thank
you, everybody

168
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,597
Did you three finish your
homework for today?

169
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,498
Not yet

170
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,666
Go and finish that first

171
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,868
Okay.. let's go upstairs

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,708
I give them credit... They
must be feeling lonely

173
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,110
Without their dad

174
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,146
The adults have to
do their best, too

175
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,784
This is tough... We're
only up to 2:30

176
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,387
It'll be exhausting to do
this for the whole summer

177
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,088
That's right

178
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:19,991
Hitomi!

179
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,293
1

180
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,594
What happened to Dad?

181
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,864
Momoko! Haven't you
gone to the hospital?

182
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,799
Of course not! I heard the
message and rushed

183
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,434
right over here

184
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,835
Why? I left a message
for you to come to the

185
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,203
hospital, didn't I?

186
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,772
I thought I'd come here
first to find out what

187
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,007
was going on. I figured
someone would be here.

188
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,443
How is he? You said he
broke his bone

189
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,846
Where? Was it his back?
His ribs? His skull?

190
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,248
Tell me!

191
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,716
His left knee.

192
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,451
His knee?

193
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,087
It's just his knee..
Everything else is fine

194
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,524
Will he be able to
walk again?

195
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,260
What about physical therapy?
Will it take about three years?

196
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,896
He'll be fine after a
month in the hospital

197
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,699
One month...?

198
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,968
There won't be any
after effects, and

199
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,404
he'll be able to return
to his normal routine.

200
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,612
It wasn't as bad
as I feared

201
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:24,189
jia iJi» ii) iji j iJjjylaia

202
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,690
That's right

203
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,025
At home, too

204
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,227
He broke his bone at home?

205
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,230
That's right. He fell down

206
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,934
What is he doing? Getting
hurt inside the house

207
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,003
It happens often to
old people

208
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,971
Because their
muscles are weak

209
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,107
He was feeiing under the
weather from the heat

210
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,475
Right, Ume?

211
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,810
He seemed tired when
he climbed the stairs,

212
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,213
and I heard this loud
clattering sound...

213
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,316
I yelled, "Katsu" as
he came tumbling down

214
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,953
That's right, when I heard
that, I came running over

215
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,155
He was at the bottom of
the stairs groaning

216
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,125
so loud and his face looked

217
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,926
he Itfiis ace

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,129
That's how he
always looks.

219
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,832
This is ridiculous!

220
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,634
I got worried
for nothing.

221
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,004
Don't say that, let's
go to the hospital.

222
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,740
The hospital?

223
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,542
What are you saying?
You're his daughter!

224
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,511
If I go, he ll just say
something sarcastic like

225
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,580
"Oh, y tic fo^^now I feel worse"

226
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,084
I think definitely,
he will be happy.

227
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,753
in that case...

228
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,023
Come, and help out
over here then.

229
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,827
We were just discussing
who can do what, and

230
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,430
when they can come
to help out.

231
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,901
Actually, it's not easy..

232
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,869
We were just saying how
exhausting it would be

233
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,938
to do it for a whole summer

234
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,207
It really will help if
you pitch in

235
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,076
I'm really busy at work.

236
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,511
Can't you do something?

237
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,146
Your office is early, so
you could op on

238
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,848
your way o o es
calls, or something

239
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,583
Just do what you can..

240
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,819
Keiko and I are
both busy, too

241
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,087

Is this any time to be
so small-minded?

246
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,032
I am not! Do you know
what that old man

247
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,735
put me through all
these years

248
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,471

258
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,932
Especially since
it's summer...

259
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,335
And it's so hot

260
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,403
she's sure to collapse.

261
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,775
All right, if it's for
Hitomi's sake, I will.

262
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,476
That's right.

263
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,411
It's not for Dad's sake,
but for Hitomi and

264
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,280
the children's sake

265
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,251
All right. I'll do it

266
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,387
That's that then.
Give her a hand

267
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,158
I'm hungry

268
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,261
Ume made omeman sushi.

269
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,833
I'm exhausted.

270
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,603
I think this might be the
chance for those two

271
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,906
to make up.

272
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,241
I think so, too

273
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,244
If he learns that Momoko's
helping at home,

274
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,147
I know he'll be happy,
deep down in his heart

275
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,117
Find the right timing, and
take her to see him

276
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,718
in the hospital.

277
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,455
I'll find the right timing,
and give it a try

278
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,608
Everyone was going to
work together to get

279
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,745
through the one month that
Katsutaro would be gone

280
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,889
The summer had
just begun

00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,596
Katsirtaf^iad a broken knee
after falling down the

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,365
airs in his store, so he

00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,534
o pital for about a month

00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,726
YotTre the children of
this tenem lit here .

12
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,828
isn't that right?

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,666
So while Katsu s gone
for a montfi. I thought

14
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,236
we could all help
Katsu's family

15
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,704
hat do you think?

16
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,472
xcuse me

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,308
When I overworked myself
Vf
e asi time an

18
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,778
collapsed, I realized that
if i let stubb >n pride

19
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,249
get in the way, Ml only
inconvenience everybody.

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,719
So this time, Please let me
rely on every tie's help...

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,254
PJease help me out.

22
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,322
Please help us.

23
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,827
We're neighbors
^aren't we?

24
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,731
I'll do anything
I can do to help.

25
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,566
I will, too

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,069
Whenever I have time,
III stop by here.

27
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,539
Thank you

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,376
Let's all discuss what
we can do to help

29
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,012
What about the
store, Yu?

30
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,147
Thats true...1fifs
closedjor a month.

31
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,550
he'll lo ^ money,
6aij I.UOM

32
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,219
That's what I thought, so
before I left, I asked

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,787
Katsu about it

34
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,556
If he panted to keep the
store open, I'm willing

35
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,424
to watch the store for Jiim

36
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,293
What clidT)ad say?

37
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,994
He said he would feel
bad, and he didn't

38
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,863
want to me to overdo it

39
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,532
But he really wants
to keep it open.

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,101
Dad was proud of the fact
that he never closed

41
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,304
He said the customers made
time jn their busy schedules

42
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,940
to come to the store, so it
was his job to stay there

43
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,008
and wait for them to?ome

44
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,582
What is it? Go ahead,
anfl say it

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,020
Why don't we just decide
to keep it open then?

46
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,856
I'll watch the store

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,326
When I'nrrwatching the
tore people buy

48
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,294
a lot of shirts

49
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,832
But we cari't "havcyou "watch
t ^ store all day long

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,372
Why don't we take turns?

51
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,774
Whoever has the lime
can come, and do it.

52
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,310
That's an Idea

53
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,879
|A/hy don't we do this then?

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,448
Let's make up
a schedule

55
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,916
Schedule?

56
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,518
We'll figure out what has to
oe one ai nome an ai

57
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,422
the store, and make up a
schedule of who can help.

58
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,759
We'll decide who can
do what arid when

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,394
We'll divide up the work

60
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,929
That's a good idea

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,465
Let's m \e up a schedule
for a whole day then.

62
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,966
Let's do it

63
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,468
You can be the "shoki."

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,203
What's a "shoki"?

65
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,471
Don't youknowaMiat
a "shoki" is?

66
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,639
A cup or a bowl?

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,340
That's "sh W' (dishes).

68
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,808
You did that on
purpose, didn't you?

69
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,212
Of course! I don't want to
be a "shoki" (secretary)

70
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,582
I'm the chairman, and
you're the secretary

71
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,452
All right. I'll do it
I'll ^rightljack.

72
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,922
What is he doing?

73
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,261
Let's start with morning.

74
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,398
ere i you gei
ITat. Yu 1>?

75
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,835
Don'tget hun up on
details, M ko.

76
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,205
Let's get back o this..
What abSlit the 1>rnings .?

77
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,408
In the m Tning, it'sjust
breakfast and the laundry,

78
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,843
so the children and I can
do that by ourselves.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,745
When I'm on the {light shift,
I Jl come by to help when

80
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,780
I get off fromVork.

81
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,981
That would help a lot.

82
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,684
After bre icfast, you have
to go to your fcrt-time

83
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,452
job, don't you, Hitomi?

84
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,920
that's ight. So the
children will be alone

85
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,722
after I leave...

86
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,791
It's summer vacation,
isn't \{?

87
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,326
I'll stud$ in the morning.

88

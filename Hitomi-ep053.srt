00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:09,021
HITOMI

CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 53

3
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,440
Please... take good care of Keiko.

4
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,800
Dad!

5
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:21,962
I'll do my best.

6
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:23,898
I'm counting on you.

7
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:30,304
Cheers!

8
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,507
Congratulations!

9
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:43,216
A few days later...

10
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,553
Keiko's going to treat you?

11
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:50,123
She said she wants to offer me lunch...

12
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:53,493
to thank me for helping
out with Mr. Katsumata.

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,096
Is that right? That's good,
let her treat you to lunch.

14
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,633
I'm happy about Keiko's
wedding, but I'm also

15
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,103
happy that you and Keiko
have gotten close.

16
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:08,441
Is everything ready?

17
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,610
Let's eat then.

18
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,385
Keiko's getting married, isn't she?

19
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,121
That's right. Though they
haven't set the date yet.

20
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,290
I wonder if we can
also go to the wedding?

21
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,292
Sure we can, since she's our sister.

22
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:28,760
I can't wait...

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,961
What will everyone wear?

24
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,329
I'm going to wear my school uniform.

25
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,530
I'll wear a dress.

26
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,399
Shota, how about a bow tie?

27
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,942
I haven't met with
Katsumata since then.

28
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:47,678
Really, why not?

29
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,514
He's really busy.

30
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,949
A web designer is up against
a deadline every day.

31
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,552
Almost like he lives in his office.

32
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:57,922
Then you can't really go on dates.

33
00:02:57,922 --> 00:02:59,890
Especially with your
irregular work schedule.

34
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,559
We make up for that with e-mails.

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,763
Sometimes he'll send me
two e-mails in one hour.

36
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,799
Here's one now.

37
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:12,803
I thought so.

38
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:15,272
He's going on a business 
trip this weekend.

39
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,274
It must be rough.

40
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,543
Hitomi!

41
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,711
Mom!

42
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,781
I'll go ahead and sit over there.

43
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,483
I'm sorry...

44
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,652
He's one of our 
client's department head.

45
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,220
We're having a meeting.

46
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,389
I'm sorry about the other day, Keiko.

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,727
You had to witness such an awkward moment...
But maybe that's why it went so smoothly

48
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,630
when Keiko went to tell
him about her marriage!

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,033
You're kidding! It went well?
He gave his okay?

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,601
He did.

51
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,203
I'm so glad.

52
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,138
Congratulations!

53
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:50,673
Thank you.

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,277
How about we have
coffee together after this?

55
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,280
My meeting should take
only about 30 minutes.

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,048
It's okay with me.
What about you, Keiko?

57
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,650
Sure. It's okay.

58
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,319
In the meantime, you two can
finish your lunch.

59
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,121
I'll see you later.

60
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:11,860
Ms. Ippongi!

61
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,228
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,999
She sure is cheerful.

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,568
She's such a scatterbrain.

64
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,770
But it's kind of a strange feeling.

65
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:33,647
She's Dad's real daughter,
and you're her daughter...

66
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:42,056
And I'm Dad's other daughter.
It's just a strange feeling.

67
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:48,595
Shall we eat?

68
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:58,305
Enjoy your coffee.

69
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:02,075
I heard from Mom that you
used that bedroom since

70
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,710
you were eight years old.

71
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,547
Yes... Until I left when I was 18,
so I lived there for 10 years.

72
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:10,650
That's the room Yuria
and I are using, right?

73
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:15,154
That was always my room, 
but for 10 years

74
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:20,393
you were raised seeing
the same scenery, weren't you?

75
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:21,660
That's true.

76
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,797
It's like you're a younger
student from the same school.

77
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,199
I ran away from there,
so I'm a drop-out, but

78
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,868
Keiko is the Ippongi school's
outstanding student,

79
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,337
I wouldn't say that.

80
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:34,206
I used to fight with Dad all the time.

81
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,775
But you always made up with him, right?

82
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,045
My fight with him has been
continuing all this time.

83
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,913
That old man's so stubborn.

84
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,717
Both of you are the same.

85
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:48,953
Whenever you talk with Grandpa,
it turns into a big display.

86
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,756
He calls you a sly northern
fox, and you call him

87
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,358
A sly old man, 
or an old raccoon dog.

88
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:56,728
I never called him 
an old raccoon dog.

89
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,162
Yes, you did.

90
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,831
You're terrible!

91
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:02,533
You were the one who called
him an old raccoon dog!

92
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,202
Oh really?

93
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:06,237
Yes, I never called him
an old raccoon dog.

94
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:07,738
I only said little raccoon dog...

95
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:08,939
That's terrible, isn't it?

96
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,012
I meant to treat Hitomi
to lunch, but you ended

97
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,914
up treating me instead.

98
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,083
It's okay... 
this is a rare occasion.

99
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:22,152
Are you going to work now?

100
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,754
I'm working the night shift.

101
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,355
It must be rough.

102
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:26,957
Do your best.

103
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,894
I'll leave you here.

104
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:33,230
Thank you for the meal. 
Excuse me...

105
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,165
Keiko!

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,901
Congratulations.

107
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,703
Thank you.

108
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:50,012
This is the first time
I've had a good chance to

109
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:51,280
talk with her at length.

110
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,049
How does it feel?

111
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:55,718
It's a strange feeling...

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,155
She's like a little sister,
and yet she's also like

113
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:01,790
an underclassman
from the same school.

114
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,561
But at this point she's more
Dad's daughter than I am...

115
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:19,908
I'm home!

116
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,443
Come over here, Hitomi.

117
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:22,644
Hello.

118
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,550
I'm glad you're home.

119
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,652
We came to make an announcement.

120
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,656
We normally send this by mail...

121
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,991
Listen carefully now.

122
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:40,828
With Katsutaro as the
designated foster parent,

123
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:44,932
and Hitomi as his assistant,
the Ippongi family has been

124
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:49,403
officially recognized by the city
of Tokyo as a foster care home.

125
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,672
Congratulations!

126
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,974
Thank you! We did it!

127
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,642
We did it!

128
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,111
Can I take a look?

129
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,081
Here's my name...

130
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,884
Ippongi Hitomi

131
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,952
That's great!

132
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:13,193
In the case of the Ippongi family,
since Katsutaro's wife Setsuko died

133
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:18,064
they reapplied to be recognized
as a foster care home.

134
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,535
After deliberation by the
child welfare office,

135
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,238
they have been officially
authorized as a foster home.

136
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,643
We are really relieved.

137
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,814
Because of your track record,

138
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,917
we were sure it would be okay,
but until the decision was made

139
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,653
official, we couldn't relax..

140
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,421
Thank you.

141
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,390
We owe it all to you.

142
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:45,991
It was our pleasure.

143
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:50,295
So now, you'll have to
go through the newly

144
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,597
registered foster parent training.

145
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,133
What?

146
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,935
The newly registered
foster parent training.

147
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,270
Foster parent training...?

148
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,105
It's a two-day training that
you have to go through.

149
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,173
You'll have sit-down learning,
a tour of an institution

150
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,542
and you'll be interacting
with other foster parents.

151
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,911
I think it'll be a 
good learning experience.

152
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,780
I'll definitely go.

153
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,315
Even if I have to take 
time off from school.

154
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,451
Thank you so much.

155
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,954
Akira, Yuria and Shota can
really feel reassured!

156
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:20,091
Mr. Wakayama...

157
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,060
Mr. Takayanagi...

158
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,062
Ms Inoue...

159
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:27,231
Truly, thank you very much.

160
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,668
Let's have fun and 
do our best together.

161
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,336
I will.

162
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:35,072
If you have any problems,
you can come crying to us anytime.

163
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,174
I will... I'll come crying to
you, please take care of me.

164
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,311
I'm so glad.

165
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,600
Hey, everybody!

166
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,470
Let's make another toast.

167
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:11,040
Katsu, enough with 
making so many toasts

168
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:14,110
Even if you leave 
we'll go on toasting

169
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,778
it's such a special occasion.

170
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,313
Hitomi!

171
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:18,948
Thank you!

172
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,617
Thanks to you, we've been
officially recognized

173
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,452
as a foster care home.
Congratulations!

174
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,587
Cheers!

175
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:33,061
Keiko, congratulations 
on your marriage!

176
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:36,231
Cheers!

177
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,503
I can't move! I'm stuffed.

178
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,340
So many happy things
are happening one after

179
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,141
another at this house, aren't they?

180
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:50,111
The only thing left is making
up with Momo-chan, isn't it?

181
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,014
Yujiro...

182
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:57,151
Let's stop talking about that, ok?

183
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,186
If you say so!

184
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:04,291
Excuse me for a minute.

185
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,393
Where are you going?

186
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:09,763
I feel hot, so I'm going
to cool down a bit.

187
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,302
Will he be okay? He might fall
off the balcony.

188
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,971
Hitomi... go and 
check on your grandpa.

189
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:19,473
I will.

190
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:26,112
Grandpa!

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,781
Hitomi...

192
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:31,084
What's up, you must be tired...

193
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,786
From saying 'congratulations' 
too many times.

194
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,089
No... that's not it.

195
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,058
I just started feeling serious.

196
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,961
Serious?

197
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:48,467
I'm so glad I started 
being a foster parent.

198
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:55,274
Thanks to that, I can be this
happy for Keiko.

199
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,115
There are a lot of painful
and rough times, but

200
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:06,785
I think there are 
a few more happy times.

201
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,856
From now on, I can experience
a whole lot of different

202
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:14,426
feelings with Shota, 
Yuria, and Akira...

203
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,436
I'm really grateful 
for their existence.

204
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,742
They're making my 
life really enjoyable...

205
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:40,284
Even though our last 
names are different...

206
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:46,123
So I wonder why your mom
and I have the same last

207
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:50,461
name, but we just can't get along..

208
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,763
It's so strange, isn't it?

209
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:01,004
"A strange feeling..."

210
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:04,641
Hitomi heard this phrase
so many times today

211
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:08,578
This evening she's thinking many feelings
arise that can't be easily expressed

212
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:14,183
between parent and child...
family... or person to person

213
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,530
Another part-time job...?

214
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,399
Yes, the president from
the last time called me,

215
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,635
and said we did such a
good job that he wanted

216
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,670
to know if the four 
of us would do it again.

217
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,205
The "Eyebrow Cats" thing again?

218
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:37,439
Seems likely...

219
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,373
What will you do?

220
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:39,441
I'll do it!

221
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,976
That was fast.

222
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:43,812
We're lucky that we 
can get paid to dance.

223
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,948
The part-time job I have
now at the pub is terrible.

224
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:48,784
They really work you to death.

225
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,118
Don't say that!

226
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,287
I'm the one who 
introduced you to that job.

227
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,755
What about you, Hitomi?

228
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:54,656
I'll do it.

229
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:56,291
It was so much fun last time.

230
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:58,793
What about you, Junko?

231
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,962
I'll do it. 
I have no choice, do I?

232
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,931
You need four people 
to do it, don't you?

233
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:07,735
Okay then we'll gather on Saturday
at the Aoyama office like the last time.

234
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:09,670
OK!

235
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,305
Be there by 6AM.

236
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,740
That's so early!

237
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,275
It's too early.

238
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,943
This time is a business trip

239
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,278
It's in Atami.

240
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,546
Atami?

241
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,952
On Saturday, Hitomi and
group arrived at the

242
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:26,420
office in Aoyama.

243
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,188
Good morning!

244
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:31,224
We're counting on you again!

245
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:32,960
As soon as we get 
all this stuff ready,

246
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,127
we'll be leaving.

247
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,696
In the meantime, sit down,
and read the pamphlet.

248
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,743
Atami... Just hearing the name echo

249
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,679
filled Hitomi with anticipation.

CHAPTER 9
I'm Getting Married"

2
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,541
Please... take good care of Keiko

3
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,745
Dad

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,281
I'll do my best.

5
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,249
I'm counting on you.

6
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,656
Cheers!

7
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,859
Congratulations!

8
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,569
A few days later...

9
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,872
Keiko's going to treat you?

10
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,442
She's said she wants to offer me lunch

11
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,812
to thank me for helping out with Mr. Katsumata.

12
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,449
Is that right? That's good, let her treat you to lunch.

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,986
I'm happy about Keiko's wedding, but I'm also

14
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,456
happy that you and Keiko have gotten close.

15
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,794
Is everything ready?

16
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,930
Let's eat then.

17
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,739
Keiko's getting married, isn't she?

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,475
That's right. Though they haven't set the date yet.

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,644
I wonder if we can also go to the wedding?

20
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,613
Sure we can, since she's our sister.

21
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,081
I can't wait...

22
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,282
What will everyone wear?

23
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,650
I'm going to wear my school uniform.

24
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,851
I'll wear a dress.

25
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,720
Shota, how about a bow tie?

26
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,297
I haven't met with Katsumata since then.

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,000
Really, why not?

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,868
He's really busy

29
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,271
A web designer is always up against a deadline every day.

30
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,907
Almost like he lives in his office

31
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,243
Then you can't really go on dates

32
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,245
Especially with your irregular work schedule

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,881
We make up for that with email 

34
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,084
Sometimes he'll send me two e-mails in one hour

35
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,121
Here's one now

36
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,158
I thought so

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,594
He's says he's going on a business trip this weekend, too

38
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,629
It must be rough

39
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,898
Hitomi!

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,067
Mom!

41
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,103
I'll go ahead and sit over there.

42
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,805
I'm sorry...

43
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,975
He's our client department head

44
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,543
We're having a meeting

45
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,712
I'm sorry about the other day Keiko

46
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,050
You were forced to witness such an awkward moment...But maybe that's why it went so smoothly

47
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,986
when Keiko went to tell him about her marriage!

48
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,356
You're kidding! It went well - he gave his okay?

49
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,924
He did.

50
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,526
I'm so glad.

51
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,461
Congratulations!

52
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,029
Thank you

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,601
How about we have coffee together after this?

54
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,604
I think the meeting should take only about 30 minutes.

55
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,372
It's okay with me. What about you, Keiko?

56
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,007
Sure. It's okay.

57
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,643
In the meantime, you two can finish your lunch

58
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,478
I'll see you later

59
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,217
Ms. Ippongi!

60
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,552
I'm sorry

61
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,323
She sure is cheerful.

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,892
She's such a scatter brain

63
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,128
But it's kind of a strange feeling

64
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:33,972
She's Dad's real daughter, and you're her daughter

65
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:42,381
And I'm Dad's yet one more daughter; it just a strange feeling

66
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,920
Shall we eat?

67
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,630
Take your time

68
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,401
I heard from Mom that you used that bedroom since

69
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,036
you were eight years old

70
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,873
Yes... Until I left when I was 18, so I lived there for 10 years

71
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,009
That's the room Yuria and I are using, right?

72
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,480
That was always my room, but for 10 years 

73
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,583
you were raised seeing the same scenery

74
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,719
weren't you?

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,987
That's true.

76
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,123
It's like you're a younger student from the same school

77
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,526
I ran away from there, so I'm a drop-out

78
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,195
Keiko is the Ippongi school's outstanding student

79
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,664
I wouldn't say that.

80
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,533
I used to fight with Dad all the time.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,102
But you made up with him, right

82
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,372
My fight with him has been continuing all this time

83
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,240
That old man's so stubborn

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,044
That's the same for the both of you

85
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,281
Whenever you talk with Grandpa, it turns into a big display

86
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,084
He calls you a sly northern fox, and you call him

87
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,685
A sly old man, or an old raccoon dog

88
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,055
I never called him an OLD raccoon dog

89
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,490
Yes, you did.

90
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,158
You're terrible!

91
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,861
You were the one who called him an OLD raccoon dog!

92
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,529
Oh really?

93
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,565
YES, I never called him an OLD raccoon dog

94
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,066
I only said little raccoon dog... 

95
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,267
That's terrible, isn't it?

96
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,340
I meant to treat Hitomi to lunch, but you ended

97
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,242
up treating me instead

98
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,411
It's okay... this is a rare occasion

99
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,481
Are you going to work from now?

100
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,082
I'm working the night shift.

101
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,684
It must be rough

102
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,285
Do your best

103
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,223
I'll leave you here.

104
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,558
Thank you for the meal. Excuse me...

105
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,494
Keiko!

106
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,230
Congratulations

107
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,032
Thank you

108
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,342
This is the first time I've had a good chance to

109
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,610
talk with her at length

110
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,378
How does it feel?

111
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,047
It's a strange feeling.

112
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,484
She's like a little sister, and yet she's also like

113
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,120
an underclassman from the same school.

114
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,891
But at this point she's more Dad's daughter than I am..

115
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,238
I'm home!

116
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,773
Come over here, Hitomi

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:22,974
Hello.

118
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm glad you're home

119
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,982
We came to make an announcement.

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,986
We normally send this by mail...

121
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,322
Listen carefully now

122
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,159
With Katsutaro as the designated foster parent

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,263
and Hitomi as his assistant, the Ippongi family has been

124
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,866
officially recognized by the city of Tokyo as a

125
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,734
foster care home

126
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,003
*Congratulations*

127
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,306
Thank you! We did it!

128
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,974
We did it!

129
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,442
Can I take a look?

130
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,413
Here's my name..

131
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,216
Ippongi Hitomi

132
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,284
That's great!

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,525
In the case of the Ippongi family, since Katsutaro's wife Setsuko died

134
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,361
they reapplied to be recognized as

135
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,396
a foster care home.

136
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,868
After deliberation by the child welfare office

137
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,570
they have been officially authorized

138
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,976
We are really relieved

139
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,146
Because of your track record

140
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,250
we were sure it would be okay, but until the decision was made

141
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,986
official, we couldn't relax.

142
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,754
Thank you.

143
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,723
We it all to you.

144
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,324
It was our pleasure

145
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,327
So now, you'll have to go through the newly

146
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,629
So now, you'll have to go through the newly

147
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,931
registered foster parent training

148
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,467
What?

149
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:55,967
The Newly registered foster

150
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,269
Newly registered foster parent training

151
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,603
Foster parent training?

152
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,438
It's a two-day training that you have to go through

153
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,507
You'll have sit-down learning, a tour of an institution

154
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,876
and you'll be interacting with other foster parents

155
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,245
I think it'll be a good learning experience.

156
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,114
I'll definitely go.

157
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,649
Even if I have to take time off from school

158
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,785
Thank you so much.

159
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,289
Akira, Yuria and Shota can really feel reassured!

160
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,425
Mr. Wakayama.

161
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,395
Mr. Takayanagi.

162
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,397
Ms Irioue.

163
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,566
Truly, thank you very much

164
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,002
Let's have fun and do our best together

165
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,671
I will.

166
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,407
If you have any problems, you can come crying to us anytime

167
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,509
I will... I'll come crying to you, please take care of me.

168
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,646
I'm so glad.

169
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,936
Hey, everybody!

170
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,806
Let's make another toast.

171
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,376
Katsu, enough with making so many toasts

172
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,446
Even if you leave we'll go on toasting

173
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,114
it's such a special occasion

174
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,649
Hitomi!

175
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,284
Thank you!

176
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,953
Thanks to you, we've been officially recognized

177
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,788
as a foster care home. Congratulations!

178
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,924
Cheers!

179
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,398
Keiko, congratulations on your marriage!

180
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,568
Cheers!

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,840
I can't move! I'm stuffed

182
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,677
So many things to celebrate are happening one after

183
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,479
another at this house, aren't they!

184
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,448
The only thing left is making up with Momo-chan, isn't it?

185
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,351
Yujiro

186
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,489
Let's stop talking about that, ok?

187
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,524
If you say so.

188
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,629
Excuse me for a minute

189
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,731
Where are you going?

190
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,101
I feel hot, so I'm going to cool down a bit

191
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,640
Will he be okay? He might fall off the balcony.

192
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,309
Hitomi... go and check on your grandpa

193
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,811
I will

194
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,451
Grandpa!

195
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,119
Hitomi

196
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,423
What's up, you must be tired...

197
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,125
From saying 'congratulations' too many times

198
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,428
No... that's not it

199
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,397
I just started feeling serious.

200
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,300
Serious?

201
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,807
I'm so glad I started being a foster parent

202
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,613
Thanks to that, I can be this happy for Keiko

203
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,455
There are a lot of painful and rough times, but

204
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,125
I think there are a little bit more happy times

205
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,196
From now on, I can experience a whole lot of different

206
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,766
feelings viith Shota, Yuria, and Akira.

207
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,777
I'm really grateful for their existence

208
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,083
They're making my life really fun...

209
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:40,625
Even though our last names are different..

210
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,464
So I wonder why your mom and I have the same last

211
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,802
name, but we just can't get along.

212
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,104
It's so strange, isn't it?

213
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,346
A strange feeling.

214
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,983
Hitomi heard this phrase so many times today

215
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,920
This evening she's thinking many feelings arise that can't be easily expressed 

216
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:14,526
between parent and child...family...or person to person

217
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,872
Another part-time job...?

218
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,742
Yes, the president from the last time called me

219
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,977
and said we did such a good job that he wanted

220
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,013
to know if the four of us would do it again.

221
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,548
The "Mayuge Neko' thing again?

222
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,782
Seems likely...

223
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,716
What will you do?

224
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,784
I'll do it!

225
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,319
That was fast

226
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,155
We're lucky that we can get paid to dance.

227
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,292
The part time job I have now at the pub is terrible

228
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,127
They really work you to death

229
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,461
Don't say that!

230
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,630
I'm the one who introduced you to that job

231
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,098
What about you, Hitomi?

232
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,999
I'll do it.

233
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,634
It was so much fun last time.

234
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,137
What about you, Junko?

235
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,306
I'll do it. I have no choice, do I?

236
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,274
You need four people to do it, don't you?

237
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,277
Okay then we'll gather on Saturday at the Aoyama office like

238
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,079
the last time

239
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,014
OK!

240
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,649
Be there by 6AM

241
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,084
That's so early!

242
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,619
It's too early

243
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,287
This time is a business trip

244
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,622
It's in Atami.

245
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,890
Atami?

246
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:22,293
On Saturday, Hitomi and group arrived at the office

247
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:22,927
On Saturday, Hitomi and group arrived at the office

248
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,296
On Saturday, Hitomi and group arrived at the office

249
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,764
Good morning

250
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,533
Good morning

251
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,569
We're counting on you again!

252
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,304
As soon as we get all this stuff ready

253
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,472
we'll be leaving.

254
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,041
In the meantime, sit down, and read the pamphlet

255
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,089
Atami - Just hearing the name echo 

256
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,024
filled Hitomi with anticipation

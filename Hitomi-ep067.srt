CHAPTER 12
I Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 67

2
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,193
The usual town
August, 2007

3
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,694
turned into a
festival town

4
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,229
turned into a
festival town.

5
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,138
It's a minor festival the year 
before the real Tsukuda Festival.

6
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,007
During this time, Ume's "inari"
sushi is in great demand

7
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,580
Will you hurry up?
Everyone's waiting.

8
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,982
Stop nagging

9
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,650
Just hold your horses

10
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,386
Are you all waiting for
the "inari" sushi?

11
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,655
I'm going to take some
to Mari's place

12
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,091
I'm going to pass it out
to all of my customers

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,895
I'm going to take some to the
neighborhood association

14
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,363
They look forward
to it every year

15
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,500
Come on in and have
some, Hitomi.

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,235
Is it OK?

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,903
All right!

18
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,041
This year is just a minor
festival, isn't it?

19
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,477
The real festival is once
every three years, so

20
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,046
since the last real festival
was in 2005, we had

21
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,083
minor festivals in 2006
and 2007. The next real

22
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,051
festival will be in 2008.

23
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,887
This year is already
2007

24
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,623
Next year is the
real festival

25
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,424
You should see the
real festival...

26
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,126
It's something else!

27
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,195
When you see me carrying
the portable shrine,

28
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,364
you'll fall in love with
me all over again

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,866
She's not in
love with you yet!

30
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,068
Then she'll fall for 
the first time

31
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,370
Pretty sure that's not
happening

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,943
The Tsukuda Festival is
the Sumiyoshi Shrine's
1977 Tsukuda Festival

33
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,813
festival that takes place 
every three years
1977 (Showa 52) 

34
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,882
The Miyamoto f portable
shrine, the right-sided

35
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,619
portable shrine tid many
ot^Wepffera

36
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,257
chance for the e pkyo
to show their do spirit

37
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,326
Many tourists attend
this festival, too.

38
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,463
In the years in between, a
'kage matsuri" (shadow festival)

39
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,099
is held in place 
of the real festival.

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,368
As Yujiro and the rest 
keep saying, 

41
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,438
the next real festival will
be held in August 2008

42
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,978
Folks around here
love the festival, so

43
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,080
A lot of my classmates
are coming to town for

44
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,849
the festival even if
it's just a minor one

45
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,818
They can't wait for next year

46
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,522
Come to think of it, Ume

47
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,858
is Tetsuo coming
for the festival?

48
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,494
Of course not, he's too lame 
to come home, that guy.

49
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,830
Who's Tetsuo?

50
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,799
Ume's son. He's my
classmate, too

51
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,469
Does he call you?

52
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,771
About once a month

53
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,274
He asks if I'm healthy,
and I say, yes I'm fine

54
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,842
Then, he just hangs up

55
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,311
Stop: Let's not
talk about that

56
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,281
Talking about her son
puts Ume in a bad mood

57
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,084
It's ready! Take as
much as you want.

58
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,853
I'll take 20

59
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,288
Me, too

60
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,923
I'll take the rest

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,858
You don't need that many.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,729
There was some situation between
Ume and her son, Tetsuo

63
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,032
that Hitomi didn't know about

64
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:29,635


65
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,502


66
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,270


67
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,810
Hitomi!

68
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,046
What a surprise, Moe!

69
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,948
Yuka! Junko!

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,118
Hey Hitomi!

71
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,653
You came to visit!

72
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,221
Yuka insisted.

73
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,490
I wanted a taste of the
downtown atmosphere.

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,625
It's not that we've made
up with each other...

75
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,993
But she pays half the
rent, so even if I

76
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,828
wanted to, I couldn't
kick her out

77
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,299
We put up a curtain, and
try to ignore each other.

78
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,668
Like this..

79
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,004
But today, let's just enjoy
the festival together

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,806
Right?

81
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,542
Yeah, you're right

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,447
Will you look at that!

83
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,251
It's awesome! It's too
dazzling. I'm blinded.

84
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,254
I can't believe they're
the same living beings

85
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,622
as Ume.. Can you?

86
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,792
Are these your friends,
Hitomi?

87
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,627
From dance school.
This is Keiko.

88
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,829
Nice to meet you.

89
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,131
Good evening

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,202
Keiko! Go over there,
and stand with them

91
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:37,969
What for?

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,037
Never mind! Just go!

93
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,038
Why?

94
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:40,872
Just go!

95
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,207
I don't want to

96
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,476
Wow!

97
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,512
It's blinding!

98
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,284
Stop it already!
It's embarrassing.

99
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,652
Don't do that!

100
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,421
Go ahead and play

101
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,357
I'll watch the kids.

102
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,092
Really?

103
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,860
Maybe I will. Thank you.

104
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,865
Yuka..

105
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,567
Stop it! Enough!

106
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,669
Quit it

107
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,606
Come and have monja.

108
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,712
This is a large serving of
spicy, salted cod roe

109
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,647
it's an extra, extra
large serving

110
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,216
What are you doing here?

111
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,053
We always come here to help
out during the festival.

112
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,856
Why didn't you tell me?

113
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,559
This is Daisuke and Shosuke
from my part-time job.

114
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,495
Good evening.

115
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,330
I'm the older brother.

116
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,431
I'm the younger brother.

117
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,665
I'm the older brother

118
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,867
I'm the younger brother

119
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,769
Good evening.

120
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,276
During the real festival,
when the portable shrines

121
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,879
come through, the spectators
throw water on the carriers

122
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,714
with buckets and hoses

123
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,117
We get soaking wet!

124
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,787
We get soaking
wet, don't we?

125
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,389
We sure do!

126
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,059
Mari, it's all ready.

127
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,831
OK, let's all go over
to Rose's place!

128
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,666
Let's go!

129
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,308
What are you doing?

130
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,910
We're all going over
to Rose's place!

131
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,712
Come on, Moe

132
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,850
Thank you all for
visiting.

133
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,285
You can't go home from
the festival without

134
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,653
hearing this..

135
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,156
Here's Festival Mari singing
the "Matsuri Samba"

136
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:47,826
After the festival,
the sun is setting.

137
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:53,331
In the evening, while a
chill wind blows

138
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:58,537
The old man whose house 
burned down and

139
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:03,808
the old woman whose secret 
savings were stolen...

140
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:14,185
keep sighing with
terrible sadness.

141
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:19,591
No matter how much they
cry, they won't go home..

142
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:25,597
No matter how much
they cry

143
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,601
All that's left is the
matsuri (festival)

144
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,778
Go on and dance!

145
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,016
What are you doing?

146
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,020
Dancing is the starting
point of life!

147
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,179
That was fun!

148
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,051
The people in Tsukishima
are awesome, aren't they?

149
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,689
It's been a long time since
I enjoyed dancing this much

150
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,593
I had forgotten
this feeling...

151
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,030
That's true.. Lately, all
I thought about was

152
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,232
getting better at dancing
or getting chosen in

153
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,700
the audition

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,574
What are you doing?

155
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,943
They're asking
for an encore!

156
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,712
Encore! Encore!
Come on!

157
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,781
Shall we go? Let's go!

158
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,496
Shota

159
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,568
And Yuria

160
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,339
She looks so good in
her cotton kimono

161
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,608
Excuse me..

162
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,343
I'm sorry! Is it too loud?

163
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,477
No, just the opposite

164
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,179
Can you turn it up
a little?

165
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,248
We can't go to the
festival either

166
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,717
We want to get into the
mood of the festival

167
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,019
Okay... I'll turn it up just
enough so we don't

168
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,187
get scolded

169
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,659
How's this?

170
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,494
That's good

171
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,765
Great

172
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,177
It's light out,
isn't it?

173
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,745
Get back to bed!

174
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,758
Which button is it?

175
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,763
Thank you very much.

176
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Ms Miura.

177
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,669
It was the three of them
who asked me to turn

178
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,037
up the volume.

179
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,605
Lights out!

180
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,410
I'm home...

181
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,348
Mom!

182
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,752
I came to help out
I got off early

183
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,488
You don't have to do that

184
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,189
I'll do it. Go and
enjoy the festival.

185
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,425
It's okay. I don't
want to go

186
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,160
Why not?

187
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,561
You haven't been to one
since you went to

188
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,163
Sapporo, have you?
It's been 17 years!

189
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,564
Go out and enjoy it

190
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,366
It's too overwhelming

191
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,137
I've told you about it, right?

192
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,006
The first time your dad
came here with me

193
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:59,210
your Grandpa asked him to carry
the portable shrine

194
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,980
You mean when he said,
how can I give Momoko

195
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,582
to a man who can't even
carry a portable shrine?

196
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,952
That was the beginning
of our big fight...

197
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,789
And when I brought you
here when you were

198
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,859
three years old, it was
during the festival too

199
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,870
That's why I can't
really enjoy the festival.

200
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,908
I feel like a stranger,
even hearing the 

201
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,076
Tsukuda festival music

202
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,916
Hitomi felt as though
she could feel a little

203
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,352
bit of the pain in
Momoko's heart.

204
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,442
The "shadow festival" was over.

205
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,915
Good morning, Ume!

206
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,585
It's over isn't it?

207
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,054
I feel a bit sad that
the festival is over.

208
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,690
We can't do anything about that...

209
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,060
But when I think how
grand it'll be,

210
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,728
I can't wait for
next year.

211
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,202
Ume?

212
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,904
What happened?

213
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,739
Ume!

214
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,775
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

215
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,444
I'm okay...

216
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,614
No, you're not
You have a fever!

217
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,615
What should I do?

218
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,949
Hang on, Ume

219
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,584
What should I do?

220
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,886
Are you OK?

221
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,421
This time it's a
crisis for Ume

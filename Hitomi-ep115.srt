4
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,890
When we finished dancing
I really felt great

5
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,028
When we finished dancing
I really felt great

6
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,731
because I gave it everything
I had, and it felt like

7
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,134
we had become one

8
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,071

9
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,840
April, 2008


10
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,807

11
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,711
Outlays after Dance Beat,
Hitomi's ankle had

12
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,580
completely healed

13
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,423
For now, Hitomi was going
to do her best with

14
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,024
the housework.

15
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,196
This is for Akira..

16
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,565
And this is for Yuria

17
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,636
Congratulations to you both
on entering new schools

18
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,505
Thank you

19
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,672
Open it

20
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,277
it's a pen case

21
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,879
It's a handkerchief set

22
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,381
Do your best in middle
school and high school

23
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:30,916
Thank you

24
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,485
Also, I brought cake

25
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,554
Let's eat it together.

26
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,723
Thank you, Keiko

27
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,626
They're my dear little
brother and little sister

28
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,731
I have an announcement
to make today.

29
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,200
What is it?

30
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,069
I changed hospitals

31
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,006
I'm going to be working
in Tsukiji now

32
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,276
You mean the hospital I
was in when I broke my leg?

33
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,480
So I'll be able to stop by
here from time to time

34
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,649
Is that right?

35
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,285
In that case
--din r w We i o orks

36
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,054
our way to or from work
I pi Jiappy to «se you

37
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,157
Speaking of Hitomi
Where is she?

38
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,358
She's taking in
the laundry

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,561
But it sure is taking
her a long time

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,170
Hitomi...?

41
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:29,474
Hitomi

42
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,543



43
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,078
Keiko

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,013
What were you daydreaming
about?

45
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,848
You were taking in the
la n fy w r4 1 o 9

46
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,284
I was just thinking
about something

47
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,153
About what?

48
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,823
There was a big dance
competition called

49
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,092
Dance Beat,4>i]t4t'£over 1m

50
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,695
I heard about it...

51
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,563
You didn't make it through
the preliminaries

52
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,665
It's too bad,
isn't it?

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,370
I see.. So you were thinking
about your frustration

54
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,942
No, not that.

55
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,013
I did all that
I could do.

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,352
the y d n't you lobk more like
ypu compli Tied something7

57
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,457
But I feel a little sad..

58
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:23,061
Like it's spring, but the
autumn winds are blowing

59
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,437
In other words, it's the
sadness you feel after

60
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,939
the festival is over

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,841
After the festival


62
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,211
fbu lit arkT all
that energy yoy built

63
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,048
up inside on the stage
that day, and burned out.

64
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,487
After a festival, I feel
like an empty shell

65
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,689
with all my spirit gone

66
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,026
You may be right.

67
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,994
Listen to this

68
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,428
Ull J y

69
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:03,602
Th dness after
the festival ends

70
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,308
It comes eve

71
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,576
Are you depressed?

72
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:12,878
Are you depressed?

73
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,018
-mum? .

74
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,259
Thank you!

75
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,330
What did you want
to talk about?

76
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,665
Do you want a beer?

77
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,634
I'm sorry... We'll have
a drink after we talk

78
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,571
I want to talk before
we get drunk.

79
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,709
YUZO

80
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,011
I told you once before


81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,313
job was to make you ay
fDIIHetiggtimanrsO

82
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,516
ou take over
Ishida Shoten.

83
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,020
Listen carefully...

84
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,723
At the end of this year,
I'm going to retire as

85
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,624
the president of
Ishida Shoten

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,361
So starting next year, you'll
be the president

87
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,003
One day, you me hotae
drunk, and told me...

88
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,273
Dad, I love dried
bonify, and I'm going

you I can do it!

90
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,945
So watch me."

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,716
It made me happy to
hear you say that

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,253
I feel like I've been
waiting years for

93
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,659
Ishida Shoten has a lot of
customers who say that

94
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,629
it has to ep r ne bonito
or they won t • y any

95
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,032
it means you have to treasure
those /eg 0 a s omfers

103
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,135
You'll have look after Nishi and
the other employees, too

104
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,940
I'll listen to what
they have to say

105
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,875
and do what I can
to help them.

106
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,446
Thanks for waiting
We'll have beer

107
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,047
Coming up!

108
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,018
Starting next year, you'll be
the president, so I'm

109
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,487
counting on you to take
care of Ishida Shoten

110
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,656
I'll do my best.

111
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,492
Yuzo! Congratulations!

112
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,094
Thank you

113
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,601
Good evening

114
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,370
Hey, Yuzo! Yujiro!

115
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,805
Sorry, Katsu

116
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,108
What is it, Yuzo?

117
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,644
Are you crying?

118
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,546
Did your dad give you
a lecture again?

119
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,881
No he didn't

120
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,551
So what are you
going to do?

121
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,555
You can't be on spring
break forever, can you?

122
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,957
What about school?

123
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,428
The class I was taking
is finished already

124
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,430
And the teacher
quit too

125
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,700
Then will you form a
new unit, and try

126
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,068
again next year?

127
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,072
I haven't thought
that far yet

128
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,308
Yuria... Can you
take this?

129
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,643
Sure

130
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,417
But you're not going fo
quit dancing, are you?

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,621
Of course not!

132
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,923
I'm glad

133
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,159
I'm happy A lit-y m'W have
more finite to look after

134
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,996
the children, but

135
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,432
But you're more energetic
when you're putting your

136
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,268
efforts to dancing

137
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,178



138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,916
I'm surprised you
made the decision.

139
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,787
I always thought I would
have to do it someday

140
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,624
Although it applies
to you, too

141
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,229
I was talking about your
dad, Ishida Yujiro

142
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,730
What is it?

143
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,399
That was a big
decision

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,201
Didn't you tell me that you
knew Yuzo was doing

145
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,138
his best, but you were
still a little bit

146
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,708
worried about him?

147
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,246
I'm still worried, but
with things like this,

148
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,316
you have to draw the
line somewhere

149
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,819
Don't worry...I'm going to
work hard from now on,

150
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,854
so don't worry

151
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,157
The president is
dried bonito

152
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,927
j* Some Tie who Work TTVd
without recognition

153
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,863
Without good dried bonito,
you can't make good food

154
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,433
But once the soup is made,
you can't see the

155
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,934
dried bonito

156
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,036
That's true

157
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,073
You have to suffer where
the employees and the

158
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,375
customers can't see

159
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,278
! understand

160
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,014
That's really
good soup e

161
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,652
Yujiro... You're talking
about dried bonito

162
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,655
Y Xi'je really aweso.i.e

163
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,990
That's true..

164
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,658
It may sound nice being
the president, but

165
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,593
it's going to be
hard isn't it

166
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,097
You should find a wife
to give you support

167
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,399
I guess

168
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,168
Next, you'll have to
fin a wife.

169
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,938
That's if he an find someone
who will marry him

170
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,541
Thank you, everyone.

171
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,711
Ishida Yuzo, will work
until I turn into the

172
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,047
dregs or the soup base

173
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,050
countma on
• I III*

174
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,085
Do your best!

175
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,695
So, Yuzo's finally going
to be the president

176
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,197
It won't be until next
year, but I tiUrd he'

177
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,866
really gung ho about it.

178
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,770
Welcome

179
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,046
What happened
to your hair?

180
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:21,913
What happened
to your hair?

right now, but once we

I want to expand
my horizons

230
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,558
I wanted to do something
that was entirely

231
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,227
different from dancing

232
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,772

Ken is selling
dried bonito?

243
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,808
He said he closed a chapter
in his dancing, so now he

244
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,177
wants to try something new.

245
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,579
And that's dried bonito?

00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,650

Thank you

I'm sorry to call you out

It's OK...I finished
cleaning up already

What did you want
to tell me?

256
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:16,421
At the Dance Beat preliminaries,
there was a producer from

257
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,790
a record company

258
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,193
He was looking for
dancers that he might

259
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,828
be able to pickup

260
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,331
f

261
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,299
Don't tell me...

262
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,701
By any chance

263
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,668
What is it?

264
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,903
Were they scouted?

265
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,804


266
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,905
Really

267
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,807

271
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,580
We did it!

272
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,681

Thank you!

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,853
Can this really
be happening?

277
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,088
Yes, it can

278
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,689
It looks like something
new has happened to

279
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,757

CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 45

2
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,340
Sano...

3
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,377
Good morning.

4
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,448
I won't interrupt.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:31,156
When you walked me home
yesterday, you told me

6
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:35,294
about your real father,
didn't you?

7
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,935
I was thinking about
that all night long.

8
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,672
About how sad it was.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,548
So Yuka is staying at
Junko's place?

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,884
That's unexpected, isn't it?

11
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,085
Isn't it?

12
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,687
They never got along.

13
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,556
She must really have
been in a bind.

14
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,425
After fighting with her
father, she left home,

15
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,194
but Yuka doesn't have
too many friends.

16
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,330
But this your chance.

17
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,298
For what?

18
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,367
For the two of them
tcrbecome friends.

19
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,170
he onH be ream
ariymo e for «ie three of

20
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,771
yd o Vm a unit.

21
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,240
That's right.

22
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,476
You said you wanted to
dance with those two.

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,812
It might become a
reality soon.

24
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,216
ould be great,
wouldn't it?

25
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,362
E^er since shfe failed the
audition, Hitomi had

26
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,931
ecome impatient with
her dancing.

27
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,170
i The classmates who hiti won
the audition seem£fl nore

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,906
alive in their movements
and their expression.

29
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,845
he felt she had to
start something.

30
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,348
Unit?

31
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,918
We .have odo T>mething.

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,854
We can' let Ky o and
i\ x not beat us

33
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,490
You can't orm a xinit unless
^ou ave ajoal.

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,692
I don't want to do it just
for e f-satisfaction.

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,594
be Dance eat

36
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,231
Ar§ you dre Tning?

37
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,935
The two of us were no goo8
at ail at the audition

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,205
That'swhywe're on odo
it withfne three of us

39
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,376
If we have uka, we re

She won't dolt.

41

Not at ail

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,220
/hen we're together, he's
either listening to music

45
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,722
by herself or watching
a dance DVD

46
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,091
It's fine with me since
I don't have to talk

47
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,427
to her or worry about her

48
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,028
I'm going to talk to her

49
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,430
Ht's no good. Hitomi.

Look tthis

84
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:30,095
When : see a lousy dancer like
her, I can't just ignore it

85
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,999
The only thing! ask is.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,137
When you all become successful,
you look after me in fny old age

87
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,139

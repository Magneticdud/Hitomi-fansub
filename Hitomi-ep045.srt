00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:09,821
HITOMI

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,963
CHAPTER 8
"Two Kinds of Love"
Episode 45

3
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,689
Sano...

4
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,692
Good morning.

5
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,762
I won't interrupt.

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,471
When you walked me home
yesterday, you told me

7
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:34,608
about your real father,
didn't you?

8
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:42,249
I was thinking about
that all night long.

9
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:46,019
About how sad it was.

10
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,862
So Yuka is staying at
Junko's place?

11
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:58,197
That's unexpected, isn't it?

12
00:01:58,197 --> 00:01:59,398
Isn't it?

13
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,000
They never got along.

14
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,869
She must really have
been in a bind.

15
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,738
After fighting with her
father, she left home,

16
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:08,507
but Yuka doesn't have
too many friends.

17
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,676
But this your chance.

18
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,611
For what?

19
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,680
For the two of them
to become friends.

20
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,516
Then it won't be a dream
anymore for the three of

21
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,117
you to form a unit.

22
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:20,586
That's right.

23
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:23,789
You said you wanted to
dance with those two.

24
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,158
It might become a
reality soon.

25
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,529
It would be great,
wouldn't it?

26
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,707
Ever since she failed the
audition, Hitomi had

27
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,276
become impatient with
her dancing.

28
00:02:48,346 --> 00:02:50,514
The classmates who had won
the audition seemed more

29
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:53,217
alive in their movements
and their expression.

30
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:59,156
She felt she had to
start something.

31
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,660
Unit?

32
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:05,229
We have to do something.

33
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:08,198
We can't let Kyoko and
her unit beat us.

34
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,834
You can't form a unit unless
you have a goal.

35
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,036
I don't want to do it just
for self-satisfaction.

36
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,938
So our goal will
be Dance Beat.

37
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,575
Are you dreaming?

38
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:22,278
The two of us were no good
at all at the audition.

39
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,548
That's why we're going to do
it with the three of us.

40
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,687
If we have Yuka, we're
guaranteed to be good.

41
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,155
She won't do it.

42
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:35,725
Don't you feel anything between
you since you're living together?

43
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,326
Not at all.

44
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,563
When we're together, she's
either listening to music

45
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,065
by herself or watching
a dance DVD.

46
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,736
It's fine with me since I don't have
to talk to her or worry about her.

47
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,338
I'm going to talk to her.

48
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:50,773
It's no good, Hitomi.

49
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:51,807
Yuka!

50
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,275
What?

51
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,378
Will you join Junko and me,
and form a unit?

52
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,846
Our goal will be
Dance Beat.

53
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,716
Why do I have to dance
with the two of you?

54
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,517
We don't think alike, and
we're on an entirely

55
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,219
different level,
aren't we?

56
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,687
That's why it's good.

57
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,622
Junko has the determination
to rise up in the world,

58
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,725
and you're very stoic, so
it'll be like a chemical

59
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:13,228
reaction and create a spark.

60
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,763
What about you?

61
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:17,932
Me?

62
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,735
I...

63
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,337
I'm big, so it'll be fun.

64
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:24,672
I'll be your weapon!

65
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,774
I'll make an awesome weapon.

66
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,076
I'm not convinced.

67
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,913
You're living with Junko,
so couldn't you consider

68
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,916
it as repayment for a day's
food and lodging?

69
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,887
Of course I'm grateful, and
I'd like to return the

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,424
favor someday, but dancing
is different.

71
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:45,425
Also...

72
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,761
I think we're all fated
to be together...

73
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:50,097
When you came to Tsukishima,
you liked it, didn't you?

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,532
What does Tsukishima have
to do with dancing?

75
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,835
It does have something
to do with dancing.

76
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,376
Here it is.

77
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:07,847
Isn't it nice?

78
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,116
Can we use this
place for free?

79
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:11,851
Sure you can.

80
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,320
You can use it whenever
I'm not using it.

81
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:17,390
You're very generous,
aren't you?

82
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,195
Look at this...

83
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,435
When I see a lousy dancer like
her, I can't just ignore it.

84
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,338
The only thing I ask is...

85
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:38,477
When you all become successful,
you look after me in my old age.

86
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:40,479
I'm just kidding!

87
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,352
What do you think, Junko?

88
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:51,156
Being able to use this place
for free, isn't bad...

89
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:53,358
What about you, Yuka?

90
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,261
How about the sound?

91
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:01,232
How rude! The amps and the
speakers are top of the line.

92
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,000
Listen to this.

93
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,654
Here you go.

94
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,789
It's a great studio, isn't it?

95
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,791
Isn't it? It costs a
lot of money.

96
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,627
Dancing is my life.

97
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,697
Look at this, everybody.

98
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,238
Awesome!

99
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,045
It's awesome!

100
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,784
What do you think?

101
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,420
This is a strong argument
to form a unit...

102
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,754
No comment!

103
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,489
Why?

104
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,525
Before I do that, there's a
lot of things I have to

105
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:06,462
think about... I can't always
stay at Junko's place.

106
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,400
Should I go back home, and
if I don't, what am I going to do?

107
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,636
I don't have time to be thinking
of forming a unit right now...

108
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:17,039
On top of that, I'm running
out of money.

109
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,146
She's a little depressed...

110
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,916
She's not used to not
having any money.

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,361
Sano...!

112
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,397
Shimada?

113
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,071
Shall we go this Sunday?

114
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,407
Where to?

115
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,711
To the place where you parted
with your real father when

116
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,047
you were five years old.

117
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,285
I wanted to see it.

118
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:13,593
I feel like I can understand how you
felt if I could just go to that place.

119
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,731
I don't want to go.

120
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,170
I know I told you about it, but
can you just forget about it already?

121
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,773
Goodbye.

122
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,275
Sano!

123
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,000
Akira... What are you doing?

124
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,536
Were you thinking
about Naoko?

125
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,272
No, I wasn't.

126
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,278
But she really is a
nice girl, isn't she?

127
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,113
What high school is she going
to take entrance exams for?

128
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,949
I don't know.

129
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:16,053
It would be nice if it's
the same as yours...

130
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,422
It doesn't matter if we
go to the same school.

131
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:21,659
Good night.

132
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,067
He's embarrassed.

133
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:33,437
How embarrassing.

134
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:37,341
Thank you for the meal.

135
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,010
I'm a little drunk.

136
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:42,512
That's right... you drank
a little too much.

137
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,848
I got carried away...

138
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,917
There wasn't anyone
to interfere, too.

139
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,252
Are you talking
about Katsu?

140
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,520
Maybe...

141
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:53,757
Mari...

142
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,058
What is it?

143
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,261
What are you doing?

144
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,531
I really like you, Mari.

145
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,301
I had fun in Kamakura, so
do you think we could

146
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:10,239
make it official... would you call it
dating or is that the wrong word?

147
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,742
Is dating a little
too formal?

148
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,012
Yu... let's not
do this.

149
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,215
What are you saying?

150
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,684
I said... let's not do
this kind of thing.

151
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:24,319
Be careful...

152
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,388
Don't fall down.
Good night.

153
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:28,090
Wait!

154
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,993
Mari!

155
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,050
Good morning, Ume.

156
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:01,889
The owner of a clothing
store has to be a dandy.

157
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:04,558
Good morning!

158
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:06,594
It looks good on you.

159
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:09,363
Yujiro...

160
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,031
What's wrong?

161
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:14,001
Aren't you going
to work today?

162
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,336
I don't feel too good.

163
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:18,338
What's with you?

164
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:19,373
I have a fever.

165
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:20,707
It's just a hangover.

166
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,142
Come with me...

167
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,176
Just come with me.

168
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:24,377
What is it?

169
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,679
Watch the shirt...
It's brand new.

170
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,713
It's brand new...

171
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:28,415
Forget the rest.

172
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,617
What does he mean?

173
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:34,220
Last night, I got drunk at
Mari's place, and I held

174
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,723
her hand...

175
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,425
You did that?

176
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,960
What did Mari do?

177
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,329
She pulled her hand away,
and told me that we

178
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,032
shouldn't do things like that.

179
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,568
She said you shouldn't
do things like that?

180
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:50,770
That's right.

181
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,706
Does that mean she jilted me?

182
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:55,207
I don't think so.

183
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,142
Haven't you heard...

184
00:11:57,142 --> 00:12:02,681
"Even if I seem indifferent,
I burn with passion for you."

185
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,983
Do you think there's hope?

186
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,718
I think so.

187
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:08,587
Thank goodness.

188
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,522
Is that why you were
drinking all night?

189
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:15,026
After I came home, I drank the whole
bottle of sake that I opened.

190
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,361
You're hopeless.

191
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,664
Thinking about it gave me a headache
and I even have a fever now...

192
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,200
What should I do now?

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,902
What am I going to
do with my life?

194
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,670
Don't get carried away.

195
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,439
I'll go with you next time, so

196
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:33,144
for today, don't think about
anything, and go to sleep.

197
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,613
Shall I think about it,
and go to sleep?

198
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:36,947
Don't think about it!

199
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:37,915
That's right.

200
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,450
I won't think about it,
and go to sleep.

201
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,384
Got it?

202
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,052
Okay... I got it.

203
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,921
I'm glad I talked to you.

204
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,423
You have great
literary talent...

205
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,494
What's wrong?

206
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:54,564
We figured out that it's just
a fever from Yujiro's wisdom.

207
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,433
Sorry to worry you.

208
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,502
Is that all?

209
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:00,470
Good night.

210
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,806
I'm leaving.

211
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,079
A part-time job dancing?

212
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,081
AII the part-time jobs
on the reception room

213
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,517
bulletin board were filled,
so I bought a magazine...

214
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,686
Look at what I found.

215
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:21,057
Looking for a dance performer?

216
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,793
It's 8000 yen for three hours!

217
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,730
It's a Sunday afternoon job, so it
can't be one of those dangerous jobs...

218
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,098
It's for an event.

219
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:31,100
You probably have to do one
of those things the idols do.

220
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,135
So what if it is?

221
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:35,404
It's 8000 yen for three hours.

222
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:37,039
I think it's a good idea.

223
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,707
Leaving the question of
forming a unit aside.

224
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:41,610
it might be good to see how
the three of you dance together.

225
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:43,845
If it's some kind of party,
maybe there'll be some

226
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:45,647
important people there.

227
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,916
Maybe a music producer
or something.

228
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,718
It's your chance, Junko.

229
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:53,788
But you wouldn't take a part time
job like this, would you, Yuka?

230
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,156
I'll do it.

231
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,092
I want the 8,000 yen.

232
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,330
I want to eat something
besides "gyoza".

233
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,199
That's it then.

234
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,434
Give them a call, Manager.

235
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:11,272
All right. I understand.

236
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:14,408
I have the address, so
I'll find it on a map.

237
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,610
Thank you.

238
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:20,314
It's okay.

239
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,850
The four of us have to go
to the office in Aoyama

240
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,218
on Sunday at 10.

241
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,354
From there, they'll take
us to where it's held.

242
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:31,391
You said "the four of us", didn't you?

243
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,326
Who's the fourth person?

244
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:34,461
Me.

245
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,998
Are you going to dance, Moe?

246
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,400
They said they need
four people to dance.

247
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,238
I can't wait... can you?

248
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:49,809
I'm looking forward to it.

249
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:51,945
What's going to happen?

CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 51

2
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,358
What do you think, Hitomi?

3
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,194
Do you think Dad will like him?

4
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,830
I think it's important to
take him by surprise.

5
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,433
You know how Katsu is so quick
to start an argument.

6
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,669
What should I do?

7
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,938
How about if the two of you
standby at Mako's place,

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,041
and Hitomi will see if he's
in the right mood, then

9
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,542
call you two over?

10
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,910
That might be a good idea.

11
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,645
Will you do it, Hitomi?
This coming Sunday.

12
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,881
Got it. We'll wait for
the perfect timing.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,916
Yuka!

14
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,119
Say farewell to being
a little rich girl.

15
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,523
Farewell, little rich girl!

16
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,759
Let's race!

17
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,330
Wait!

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,839
I'll give you credit for
making the decision to

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,909
move from that mansion to
this cramped little room.

20
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,644
She's right. There's a
world of difference

21
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,913
between this cramped little space
and your big, fancy house.

22
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,915
It's okay. I'm going to
make a brand new start

23
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,517
from this cramped
little apartment.

24
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,386
I wish you all wouldn't keep
saying "cramped little..."

25
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,658
I want to change...

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,061
If I do that, then I'm sure my
dancing will change, too.

27
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,732
Let's hurry, and eat, so we
can put your stuff away.

28
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,901
After all, this place so
small and cramped.

29
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,937
Hold it!

30
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,572
What are you doing?

31
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,040
Sorry... you wanted us
to hurry, and eat, right?

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,241
Not that!

33
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,809
What's with that sauce?

34
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,811
You put too much "rayu"!
(spicy sesame oil)

35
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,481
Don't I always tell you that
what makes or breaks the

36
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,383
"gyoza" is the sauce?

37
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,652
Yes, m'am.

38
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,861
This is how Junko and Yuka's
new life together started.

39
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,331
That's good!

40
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,785
And also, Momoko who has been
transferred to the company's

41
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,253
Tokyo branch office...

42
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,590
You mean Keiko had come
over to tell him that

43
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,158
she was getting married?

44
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,693
That's right.

45
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,862
But you and Grandpa started
fighting, so she couldn't

46
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,198
bring herself to tell him,
and she anded up going

47
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,634
home without saying anything.

48
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,003
I feel so bad about that.

49
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,372
I have to agree with you...

50
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,508
You have to be real careful
with that old man...

51
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,777
If you happen to push the
wrong button, he can be

52
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,379
really obstinate.

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,480
Ms. Ippongi!

54
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,215
Mr. Sugimoto...?

55
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,851
You're here really late, aren't you?

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,953
Working overtime?

57
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,622
Yes... what about you
Mr. Sugimoto?

58
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,223
I forgot something.

59
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,525
I'm going to spend the night here, and go

60
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:24,029
back to the main office on the
first train in the morning.

61
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,632
Juggling the work between
here and the main office

62
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,833
is really hard.

63
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,735
I'll leave everything
here in your hands.

64
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,937
I may be the branch manager
in name, but you're the

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,839
real branch manager.

66
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Stop that.

67
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,644
After all you've always
been the top in sales.

68
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,979
Be sure you sell our products
to all the department stores

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,481
here in Tokyo.

70
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,782
I have faith in you.

71
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,550
I'll do my best.

72
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,685
I'd better be going.

73
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,387
Good night.

74
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,957
Sorry about that.

75
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,792
I heard everything.

76
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,627
You're really important there, Mom.

77
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,829
That's right... I'm pretty
important here.

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,633
I'm impressed.

79
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,743
It's hard being a man.

80
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,246
It's really hard.

81
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,450
I know it's hard, but
what is that?

82
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,987
It's just plastic that
we use to pack the

83
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,622
boxes of "katsuobushi".
(dried bonito flakes)

84
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,791
I know that! I'm asking you what you're doing?

85
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,660
It relaxes me when
I break the bubbles.

86
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,297
I think I know what it is...

87
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,800
You're trying to destroy
your earthly desires.

88
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,502
Earthly desires?

89
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,939
Out of consideration for
Mari's feelings. Yu put

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,942
a lid on his burning passion for her, but

91
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,945
deep down in his heart,
he just can't forget.

92
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,382
That's why he's taking
those smoldering

93
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,551
feelings one by one, and...

94
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,353
I see...

95
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,156
But aren't there only
108 earthly desires...?

96
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,692
Yu's already destroyed
over 500 of those.

97
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,428
He has 500... my dad
has 500 of them.

98
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,230
You have 500 earthly desires?

99
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,865
No, that's not it.

100
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,900
The hardest thing for me right now is trying to

101
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,936
figure out how to make up with her.

102
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,040
Once things go bad between
you, it's hard to make

103
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,640
up, isn't it?

104
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,879
Hello!

105
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,785
I bought too much "shirasuboshi".
(small dried baby sardines)

106
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,454
Thank you for always thinking of us.

107
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,391
Yu...? What are you doing?

108
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm not doing anything.

109
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,429
I love to do this.

110
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,699
When I break the bubbles on these, it really

111
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,234
calms me down.

112
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,403
You smash it like this...
and it feels so good.

113
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:50,041
You, too? When I do this, it really calms me down.

114
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,110
Can I have one of these?

115
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,546
I'll give you a free drink when you come

116
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,414
to my place...

117
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,582
Go right ahead.

118
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,317
Thanks. Come and drink at my place again...

119
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,385
Together with Katsu.

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,387
Sure... I'll come by.

121
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,789
I'll see you again.

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,056
Goodbye.

123
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,792
Thank you.

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,564
That went rather smoothly, Dad.

125
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,599
It did, didn't it?

126
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,269
You just made up with each other.

127
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,238
We did, didn't we?

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,073
Isn't it great, Yujiro?

129
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,810
Thank you. I did it, didn't I?

130
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,344
I did it!

131
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,790
The day Keiko plans to
introduce her fiance

132
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,660
to Katsutaro is here...

133
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,532
Are you ready? I'm going
home now to see what kind

134
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,100
of mood Grandpa is in.

135
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,837
If it's okay, I'll call you, and
give you the "go" sign.

136
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,238
All right.

137
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,740
It's nerve-racking, isn't it?

138
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,876
Especially after what
happened with Momoko.

139
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,444
It was really something, wasn't it?

140
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,579
Do you remember it?

141
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,080
I can't forget it.

142
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,983
My dad was still alive then.

143
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,252
That's when you and I just
started helping out here,

144
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,553
wasn't it, Hiroshi?

145
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,856
Shall we explain it
to Mr. Katsumata?

146
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,958
Let's do it.

147
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,494
You're talking about when
he told her, "I'm disowning

148
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,796
you! Don't ever set foot in my house again", aren't you?

149
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,398
That was the second time...
When she brought Hitomi.

150
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,368
What I'm talking about is
seven years before that.

151
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,970
The first time Hitomi's
father, Nagase Wataru

152
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,738
came to visit the lppongi family.

153
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:32,911
"Momoko's Elopement Fiasco".

154
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:40,685
The portable shrines are coming
through the streets...

155
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,888
It was early afternoon of
the Tsukuda Festival...

156
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,757
Momoko comes, and says,
"Dad... there's someone

157
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,493
I want you to meet...
This is Nagase Wataru."

158
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,129
"Hey, Dad. Please let me have Momoko."

159
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,665
Katsutaro is shocked!

160
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,201
This frivolous man is the very essence of the

161
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,270
bubble economy, a man who would never fit in here
(Kanji in drawing: Nagase)

162
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,072
in downtown Tokyo. Momoko
already knew that he would

163
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,009
oppose the marriage. That's
why she brought him over

164
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,211
during the festival, hoping
she could get his approval

165
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,647
in the midst of the noise and
confusion of the festival.

166
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,383
That's not the way the ball
bounces in the real world!

167
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,852
What! This is perfect!

168
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,354
You want to marry my precious Momoko?

169
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,590
Can you carry a portable shrine?

170
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:24,296
Of course an amateur can't
carry a portable shrine!

171
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,231
Just the weight alone was too much for Nagase!

172
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,667
I can't let you have my precious Momoko!

173
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,571
Momoko is outraged! "You're an idiot, Dad! I'm not

174
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,973
staying in this house any longer!"

175
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,777
And as if they were following
the sounds of the festival

176
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,379
fading away, the two of them left town.

177
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,749
That's the full account of
Momoko's elopement.

178
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,251
Thank you for listening.

179
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,653
That's so funny.

180
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,089
How can you be so carefree?

181
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,558
What are you going to do
if that happens to us?

182
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,293
It won't happen. There isn't a festival here

183
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,661
today, is there?

184
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,130
That's not what I meant...

185
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,267
I'm talking about if Dad won't
allow us to get married.

186
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,071
If that happens, then you
can just run off, and

187
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,238
get married...

188
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,707
I don't want that!

189
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,977
I want to have Dad's blessing
when I get married.

190
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,780
In order to make sure the
timing's perfect, I'll

191
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,249
go and Judge what kind
of mood he's in first.

192
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,918
We're counting on you.

193
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,154
Here's the sauce I borrowed
from you the other day...

194
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,023
Thanks. I brought it back.

195
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,191
There was no rush...

196
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,626
The stuff you use for
business is different,

197
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,860
after all, isn't it?

198
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:29,961
Keiko...

199
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,464
Hello...

200
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,732
Who's this?

201
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,935
Mr. Katsumata... Keiko's fiancée.

202
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,204
She's going to bring him over to introduce him

203
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,438
to Grandpa today.

204
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,706
Fiancée?

205
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,008
This is Yujiro...

206
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,976
He's a really good friend of Dad's.

207
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,612
Pleased to meet you
I'm Katsumata Seiji.

208
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,581
Please let me marry Keiko.

209
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,751
Mr. Katsumata... this man isn't her father.

210
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,887
Are you okay?

211
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,656
What's wrong?

212
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,293
This is terrible. I wonder how Katsu will take this.

213
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,395
I'm a little worried.

214
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,330
He's sort of resembles your dad...

215
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,298
You think so, too?

216
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,733
It's not his looks...

217
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,671
He just doesn't seem the type
who would fit in around here.

218
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,975
I agree with you. That's why
I'm a little worried, too.

219
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,977
You're worried? So am I.

220
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,646
What's wrong? Why do you two look so serious?

221
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,283
Keiko brought her fiancée, and
she's going to introduce him

222
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,252
to Katsu today.

223
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,487
Where are they now?

224
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,588
At Mako's place.

225
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,790
I'm going to take a look.

226
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,160
I'm going to tell Yuzo.

227
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,962
Wait a minute! Make sure you don't tell Grandpa.

228
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,297
I know.

229
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,365
I know!

230
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,900
Just be sure to keep it a secret.

231
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,334
I will!

232
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,977
I'm home!

233
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,284
Shota! Stop crying, and move your hands.

234
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,619
What happened?

235
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,623
I thought Shota was quietly
drawing something, but

236
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,661
he took these markers from the store, and because he

237
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:15,200
drew a lot, the ink went through
to the tatami mat floor.

238
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,540
Look at all the colors you used... this isn't

239
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,509
going to come off.

240
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,312
It's not going to come off.

241
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,584
What kind of guy is he?

242
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,119
He's really weak.

243
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,821
He has some nerve... asking to marry Keiko.

244
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,023
She's like a little sister to me.

245
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,626
So if he's just playing around, I'll kill him.

246
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,730
It's not coming off, is it?

247
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,033
It's a waste of our whole Sunday.

248
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,237
What is this anyway?

249
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,313
Can you carry a portable shrine?

250
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,250
I've never tried.

251
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,887
Then it's no good.

252
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,989
Uncle Katsu hates guys like that, doesn't he?

253
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,557
Don't say that.

254
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,325
I want you to look at his character.

255
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,761
He's a really nice person.

256
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,763
Then just tell Uncle Katsu that.

257
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,532
Calm down...

258
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,200
What do you think, Ume?

259
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,004
Why are you tilting your head like that?

260
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,441
Because he's not the right type...

261
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,710
Not for me, but for Katsu.

262
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,384
That's her.

263
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,555
Hello, Hitomi...?

264
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,758
Keiko? Go! Go! Go!

265
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,693
Well done, everybody.

266
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,329
It's really clean now. Thank you very much.

267
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,164
You can go, and do whatever you want.

268
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,936
Grandpa's in a really good mood right now.

269
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,937
Come right now.

270
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,607
Come as fast as you can!

271
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,775
Right away.

272
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,945
All right. We're coming over now.

273
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,521
Are you ok?

274
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,426
These are really well done...

275
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,961
This is interesting.

276
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,030
You'll be another Tedanne...

277
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,681
Keiko is finally going to introduce Mr. Katsumata

278
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,283
to Katsutaro.

279
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,518
Picaro...

280
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,287
Picaro?

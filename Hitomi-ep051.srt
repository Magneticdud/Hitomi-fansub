CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 51

2
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:32,940
What do you think, Hitomi?

3
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,775
Do you think Dad will like him?

4
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,444
I think it's important to take him by surprise.

5
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:41,014
You know how Katsu is so quick to start an argument.

6
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,250
What should I do?

7
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:45,518
How about if the two of you standby at Mako's place,

8
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:48,655
and Hitomi will see if he's in the right mood, then

9
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,123
call you two over?

10
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:51,524
That might be a good idea.

11
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,226
Will you do it, Hitomi? This coming Sunday.

12
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:55,495
Got it. We'll wait for the perfect timing.

13
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:57,497
Yuka!

14
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,699
Say farewell to being a little rich girl.

15
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,103
Farewell, little rich girl!

16
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,339
Let's race!

17
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:10,943
Wait!

18
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,419
I'll give you credit for making the decision to

19
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:23,488
move from that mansion to this cramped little room.

20
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,223
She's right. There's a world of difference

21
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,526
between this cramped little space and your big, fancy house.

22
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:29,494
It's okay. I'm going to make a brand new start

23
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:31,096
from this cramped little apartment.

24
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,965
I wish you all wouldn't keep saying "cramped little..."

25
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:39,237
I want to change...

26
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:42,674
If I do that, then I'm sure my dancing will change, too.

27
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:46,344
Let's hurry, and eat, so we can put your stuff away.

28
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:48,513
After all, this place so small and cramped.

29
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,515
Hold it!

30
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,184
What are you doing?

31
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,652
Sorry... you wanted us to hurry, and eat, right?

32
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,853
Not that!

33
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,388
What's with that sauce?

34
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,423
You put too much "rayu"!
(spicy sesame oil)

35
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:02,092
Don't I always tell you that what makes or breaks the

36
00:03:02,092 --> 00:03:03,994
"gyoza" is the sauce?

37
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:06,263
Yes, m'am.

38
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:15,472
This is how Junko and Yuka's new life together started.

39
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:18,942
That's good!

40
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,395
And also, Momoko who has been transferred to the company's

41
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,863
Tokyo branch office...

42
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:44,200
You mean Keiko had come over to tell him that

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,734
she was getting married?

44
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,303
That's right.

45
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,472
But you and Grandpa started fighting, so she couldn't

46
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:52,775
bring herself to tell him, and she anded up going

47
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,244
home without saying anything.

48
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,613
I feel so bad about that.

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,982
I have to agree with you...

50
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:03,085
You have to be real careful with that old man...

51
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,353
If you happen to push the wrong button, he can be

52
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,955
really obstinate.

53
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,089
Ms. Ippongi!

54
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,824
Mr. Sugimoto...?

55
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,460
You're here really late, aren't you?

56
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:14,562
Working overtime?

57
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:16,231
Yes... what about you Mr. Sugimoto?

58
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:17,832
I forgot something.

59
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,134
I'm going to spend the night here, and go

60
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,604
back to the main office on the first train in the morning.

61
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,240
Juggling the work between here and the main office

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,441
is really hard.

63
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,343
I'll leave everything here in your hands.

64
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:31,545
I may be the branch manager in name, but you're the

65
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:33,414
real branch manager.

66
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:34,949
Stop that.

67
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,252
After all you've always been the top in sales.

68
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:40,554
Be sure you sell our products to all the department stores

69
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:42,089
here in Tokyo.

70
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,390
I have faith in you.

71
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,159
I'll do my best.

72
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,293
I'd better be going.

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,995
Good night.

74
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,565
Sorry about that.

75
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:53,400
I heard everything.

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,235
You're really important there, Mom.

77
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,404
That's right... I'm pretty important here.

78
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,241
I'm impressed.

79
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:11,350
It's hard being a man.

80
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:13,853
It's really hard.

81
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,057
I know it's hard, but what is that?

82
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,594
It's just plastic that we use to pack the

83
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,229
boxes of "katsuobushi".
(dried bonito flakes)

84
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,397
I know that! I'm asking you what you're doing?

85
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:28,267
It relaxes me when I break the bubbles.

86
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:31,904
I think I know what it is...

87
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,406
You're trying to destroy your earthly desires.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,109
Earthly desires?

89
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:40,545
Out of consideration for Mari's feelings. Yu put

90
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,548
a lid on his burning passion for her, but

91
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:46,551
deep down in his heart, he just can't forget.

92
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,988
That's why he's taking those smoldering

93
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:52,157
feelings one by one, and...

94
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:53,958
I see...

95
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:57,762
But aren't there only 108 earthly desires...?

96
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:00,298
Yu's already destroyed over 500 of those.

97
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:03,034
He has 500... my dad has 500 of them.

98
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,835
You have 500 earthly desires?

99
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,470
No, that's not it.

100
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,506
The hardest thing for me right now is trying to

101
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,541
figure out how to make up with her.

102
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,645
Once things go bad between you, it's hard to make

103
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:15,246
up, isn't it?

104
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,484
Hello!

105
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:26,390
I bought too much "shirasuboshi".
(small dried baby sardines)

106
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,059
Thank you for always thinking of us.

107
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,995
Yu...? What are you doing?

108
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,664
I'm not doing anything.

109
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:37,033
I love to do this.

110
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:40,303
When I break the bubbles on these, it really

111
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:41,838
calms me down.

112
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,008
You smash it like this... and it feels so good.

113
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:49,645
You, too? When I do this, it really calms me down.

114
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:51,714
Can I have one of these?

115
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,150
I'll give you a free drink when you come

116
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,017
to my place...

117
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,186
Go right ahead.

118
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,921
Thanks. Come and drink at my place again...

119
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,989
Together with Katsu.

120
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:01,991
Sure... I'll come by.

121
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:03,392
I'll see you again.

122
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:04,660
Goodbye.

123
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:06,395
Thank you.

124
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,167
That went rather smoothly, Dad.

125
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,202
It did, didn't it?

126
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,872
You just made up with each other.

127
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,841
We did, didn't we?

128
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,676
Isn't it great, Yujiro?

129
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,412
Thank you. I did it, didn't I?

130
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:25,947
I did it!

131
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,392
The day Keiko plans to introduce her fiancée

132
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,262
to Katsutaro is here...

133
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,134
Are you ready? I'm going home now to see what kind

134
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,702
of mood Grandpa is in.

135
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,438
If it's okay, I'll call you, and give you the "go" sign.

136
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,840
All right.

137
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,342
It's nerve-racking, isn't it?

138
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,478
Especially after what happened with Momoko.

139
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,046
It was really something, wasn't it?

140
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,180
Do you remember it?

141
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,682
I can't forget it.

142
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,584
My dad was still alive then.

143
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,853
That's when you and I just started helping out here,

144
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,155
wasn't it, Hiroshi?

145
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,457
Shall we explain it to Mr. Katsumata?

146
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,559
Let's do it.

147
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,095
You're talking about when he told her, "I'm disowning

148
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,397
you! Don't ever set foot in my house again", aren't you?

149
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,999
That was the second time... When she brought Hitomi.

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,969
What I'm talking about is seven years before that.

151
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,570
The first time Hitomi's father, Nagase Wataru

152
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,339
came to visit the lppongi family.

153
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:32,511
"Momoko's Elopement Fiasco".

154
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:40,286
The portable shrines are coming through the streets...

155
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,488
It was early afternoon of the Tsukuda Festival...

156
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,357
Momoko comes, and says, "Dad... there's someone

157
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,093
I want you to meet... this is Nagase Wataru."

158
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,729
"Hey, Dad. Please let me have Momoko."

159
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,265
Katsutaro is shocked!

160
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,801
This frivolous man is the very essence of the

161
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,869
bubble economy, a man who would never fit in here
(Kanji in drawing: Nagase)

162
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,672
in downtown Tokyo. Momoko already knew that he would

163
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,608
oppose the marriage. That's why she brought him over

164
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,810
during the festival, hoping she could get his approval

165
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,246
in the midst of the noise and confusion of the festival.

166
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,982
That's not the way the ball bounces in the real world!

167
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,451
What! This is perfect!

168
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,953
You want to marry my precious Momoko?

169
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,189
Can you carry a portable shrine?

170
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:23,894
Of course an amateur can't carry a portable shrine!

171
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,830
Just the weight alone was too much for Nagase!

172
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,265
I can't let you have my precious Momoko!

173
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,169
Momoko is outraged! "You're an idiot, Dad! I'm not

174
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,571
staying in this house any longer!"

175
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:38,375
And as if they were following the sounds of the festival

176
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,978
fading away, the two of them left town.

177
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,347
That's the full account of Momoko's elopement.

178
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:45,849
Thank you for listening.

179
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,251
That's so funny.

180
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,687
How can you be so carefree?

181
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,156
What are you going to do if that happens to us?

182
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,891
It won't happen. There isn't a festival here

183
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,259
today, is there?

184
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,728
That's not what I meant...

185
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:01,864
I'm talking about if Dad won't allow us to get married.

186
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:05,668
If that happens, then you can just run off, and

187
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,836
get married...

188
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:08,304
I don't want that!

189
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:11,574
I want to have Dad's blessing when I get married.

190
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:15,377
In order to make sure the timing's perfect, I'll

191
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,846
go and Judge what kind of mood he's in first.

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,515
We're counting on you.

193
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,751
Here's the sauce I borrowed from you the other day...

194
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:24,620
Thanks. I brought it back.

195
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,787
There was no rush...

196
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,222
The stuff you use for business is different,

197
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:28,457
after all, isn't it?

198
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:29,558
Keiko...

199
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,060
Hello...

200
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,328
Who's this?

201
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:36,531
Mr. Katsumata... Keiko's fiancée.

202
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,800
She's going to bring him over to introduce him

203
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,035
to Grandpa today.

204
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,302
Fiancée?

205
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,604
This is Yujiro...

206
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,572
He's a really good friend of Dad's.

207
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,208
Pleased to meet you I'm Katsumata Seiji.

208
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,177
Please let me marry Keiko.

209
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:52,346
Mr. Katsumata... this man isn't her father.

210
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:55,483
Are you okay?

211
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,251
What's wrong?

212
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,889
This is terrible. I wonder how Katsu will take this.

213
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:02,990
I'm a little worried.

214
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,925
He's sort of resembles your dad...

215
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:06,894
You think so, too?

216
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:08,329
It's not his looks...

217
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,266
He just doesn't seem the type who would fit in around here.

218
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,570
I agree with you. That's why I'm a little worried, too.

219
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,572
You're worried? So am I.

220
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,241
What's wrong? Why do you two look so serious?

221
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,878
Keiko brought her fiancée, and she's going to introduce him

222
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,846
to Katsu today.

223
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,082
Where are they now?

224
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:30,183
At Mako's place.

225
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:31,384
I'm going to take a look.

226
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:34,754
I'm going to tell Yuzo.

227
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:37,557
Wait a minute! Make sure you don't tell Grandpa.

228
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:38,891
I know.

229
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:39,959
I know!

230
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,494
Just be sure to keep it a secret.

231
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:42,929
I will!

232
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,571
I'm home!

233
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,877
Shota! Stop crying, and move your hands.

234
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,213
What happened?

235
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,217
I thought Shota was quietly drawing something, but

236
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:09,254
he took these markers from the store, and because he

237
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:14,793
drew a lot, the ink went through to the tatami mat floor.

238
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:22,133
Look at all the colors you used... this isn't

239
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,102
going to come off.

240
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,904
It's not going to come off.

241
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,176
What kind of guy is he?

242
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:33,711
He's really weak.

243
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,414
He has some nerve... asking to marry Keiko.

244
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,616
She's like a little sister to me.

245
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,218
So if he's just playing around, I'll kill him.

246
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,322
It's not coming off, is it?

247
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,625
It's a waste of our whole Sunday.

248
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,829
What is this anyway?

249
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,905
Can you carry a portable shrine?

250
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,841
I've never tried.

251
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,478
Then it's no good.

252
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:10,580
Uncle Katsu hates guys like that, doesn't he?

253
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,148
Don't say that.

254
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:13,917
I want you to look at his character.

255
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:16,352
He's a really nice person.

256
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,354
Then just tell Uncle Katsu that.

257
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,122
Calm down...

258
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,791
What do you think, Ume?

259
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:25,594
Why are you tilting your head like that?

260
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,032
Because he's not the right type...

261
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,301
Not for me, but for Katsu.

262
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:38,974
That's her.

263
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,145
Hello, Hitomi...?

264
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,348
Keiko? Go! Go! Go!

265
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,283
Well done, everybody.

266
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,919
It's really clean now. Thank you very much.

267
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,754
You can go, and do whatever you want.

268
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,525
Grandpa's in a really good mood right now.

269
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,526
Come right now.

270
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:02,196
Come as fast as you can!

271
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,364
Right away.

272
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:06,534
All right. We're coming over now.

273
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,110
Are you ok?

274
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,015
These are really well done...

275
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:22,549
This is interesting.

276
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:25,619
You'll be another Tedanne...

277
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,920
What's the name of this monster?

278
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:43,269
Keiko is finally going to introduce Mr. Katsumata

279
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,871
to Katsutaro.

280
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,106
Picagon...

281
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,875
Picagon?

CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 52

2
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,920
Keiko? Go! Go! Go!

3
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,200
Well done, everybody.

4
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,580
Come as fast as you can!

5
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,110
Right this way.

6
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,582
AII right. We're coming over now.

7
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,583
It makes you nervous, doesn't it?

8
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,451
After what happened with Momoko...

9
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:21,420
Mako... ?

10
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,821
What about your shop?

11
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,056
Don't worry... I left it in Hiroshi's hand.

12
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,590
No, you didn't.

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,692
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,761
Because want to see it for myself.

15
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,563
Just get back to the shop.

16
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:33,231
I'll tell you what happened later.

17
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:40,939
Keiko...

18
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:45,209
Don't any of you interfere...

19
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,678
Once it's over, I'll be sure to tell you the result.

20
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,948
Are you ready?

21
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,150
Grandpa... ?

22
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,859
Keiko's here.

23
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,700
Keiko?

24
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,498
Why are you all dressed up today?

25
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:09,800
Dad... ?

26
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,836
Do you have a minute?

27
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,337
Sure...

28
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:18,108
What is it?

29
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,945
This is Katsumata Seiji.

30
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:24,914
This is my father.

31
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,584
Pleased to meet you. My name is Katsumata.

32
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,419
Mr. Katsumata...

33
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:31,587
That's right... Mr. Katsumata.

34
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,258
Won't you come in?

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,226
Come on in.

36
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:39,328
If it's all right with you...

37
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,597
Please... come in.

38
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:47,236
I see... so you met when you were in the hospital,

39
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:48,737
and that's how you got to be friends.

40
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:50,406
That's right.

41
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,208
She really took good care of me.

42
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,948
I don't mean to be rude, but what do you do for

43
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,683
a living, Mr. Katsumata?

44
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,519
I'm a web designer.

45
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:07,455
Baby designer?

46
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:11,226
It's work that's related to the Internet...

47
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,928
He designs home pages for companies.

48
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,166
That's...

49
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,968
...really impressive, isn't it?

50
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,136
Not at all.

51
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,807
Actually...

52
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:29,977
Mr. Katsumata and I are dating.

53
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:35,382
I thought so...

54
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,218
That's what I thought...

55
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,153
You knew?

56
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,454
Of course I did.

57
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:45,425
I've been through a similar experience before as a father.

58
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:54,367
Which means...

59
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,736
What does it mean, Mr. Katsumata?

60
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:00,707
It's...

61
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,142
Shortly...

62
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,881
We're... dating with the intent to get married.

63
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:14,854
Actually, I already proposed to Keiko last week, and

64
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,989
she agreed to marry me.

65
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:26,532
So I came here today to ask you...

66
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:30,636
Please... allow me to marry Keiko.

67
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,708
Wait! Wait a minute! Raise your head.

68
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,744
Mr. Katsumata... please raise your head.

69
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,549
I see...

70
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:48,386
Mr. Katsumata...

71
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:55,360
If we make a mess out of this now, we'll regret

72
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,362
it later, so...

73
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,265
Just let me tell you this...

74
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:08,706
Keiko isn't my daughter...

75
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:16,680
She is my daughter, but she's not really my daughter.

76
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,649
Do you understand what I'm saying?

77
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,117
Keiko already told me.

78
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:21,718
She did?

79
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:28,291
Keiko's had a hard life...

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,230
She's really suffered a lot since she was a child.

81
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:40,737
Until she came to live here, she was at an orphanage...

82
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:48,845
That's why until she came here, she didn't know

83
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:52,849
much about the warmth of a family.

84
00:06:55,318 --> 00:07:04,593
So my late wife and I became her real parents, and

85
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:07,930
raised Keiko.

86
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:18,273
So to Keiko, marriage is having a family...

87
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:23,078
It means having the warmth of a family.

88
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,820
Mr. Katsumata... can you give Keiko the warmth

89
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,190
of a family?

90
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:42,363
Yes, l can. Together with Keiko, I'll do my best so

91
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,733
she'll have the warmth of a family.

92
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,335
Right now, I work for a company, but in the

93
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,871
future, I'm hoping to start my own company.

94
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,907
Once I do that, I can work at home, so Keiko

95
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,609
and I can spend as much time as possible together.

96
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:59,046
I'm a good cook, so when Keiko's busy, I can cook.

97
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,582
And we'll have about five children.

98
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,083
That many?

99
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,287
Don't worry... I love children.

100
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,065
Mr. Katsumata...

101
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,370
Have you...

102
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,472
...ever carried a portable shrine?

103
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,646
I'm sorry... I've never carried one before.

104
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,484
You haven't? Why not?

105
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,253
Grandpa!

106
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm sorry to ask you such a strange question...

107
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,506
Mr. Katsumata...

108
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:06,344
I'm really grateful.

109
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,952
I'm going to trust you, Mr. Katsumata.

110
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,661
Keiko... Thank you.

111
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:33,170
For bringing the man who means so much to you, over to meet me.

112
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:38,976
You really didn't have to worry about me.

113
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,511
Don't say that.

114
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:47,417
I wanted you to approve of the man I'm going to marry.

115
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:52,989
Thank you.

116
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:01,497
Mr. Katsumata... please...

117
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:04,500
... take good care of Keiko.

118
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:08,638
I beg of you,.. please take good care of her.

119
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,072
Dad!

120
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,008
I'll do my best.

121
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:15,144
I'm counting on you.

122
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,251
Please take good care of her.

123
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,954
I really will do my best.

124
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:37,532
Private party

125
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,702
Cheers!

126
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,072
Congratulations!

127
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,108
Go ahead, and eat Mr. Katsumata.

128
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,210
Is it okay to eat this?

129
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,311
Of course it is.

130
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,615
From what I heard, it went fairly smoothly, didn't it?

131
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,084
What was unexpected was that he didn't let the

132
00:10:57,084 --> 00:11:00,388
issue of carrying the portable shrine bother him.

133
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:03,224
Grandpa really looked happy that you came over to get

134
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,892
his approval...

135
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,528
I was happy, too.

136
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:10,898
I wanted to make sure Dad approved of him.

137
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,570
Aren't you glad that he approved?

138
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,706
So when is the wedding?

139
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,342
We haven't decided yet...

140
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,245
He's so busy that he doesn't know when he can take off.

141
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,715
Keiko... you mustn't rush a man.

142
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,651
If you rush him, he might run away.

143
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,020
Don't say strange things like that! You won't

144
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,421
run away, will you?

145
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,256
Of course, I won't!

146
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:40,626
Cheers!

147
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,902
Are you drinking, Dad?

148
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:51,537
Do you want some, too?

149
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:05,150
Keiko s getting married.

150
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:08,854
Are you happy?

151
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,123
I don't know.

152
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,259
Are you lonely?

153
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:18,463
Neither.

154
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:22,800
They must have gone home already.

155
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,506
It seems so unfair.

156
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:34,011
I've known her for 15 years, and she's going to marry

157
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,147
a man she's only known for six months.

158
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,483
I can understand how you feel.

159
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,588
It's painful being a man, isn't it?

160
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,691
It's painful for you, too, isn't it, Dad?

161
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,961
It sure is painful.

162
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,398
Let's drink tonight...

163
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,333
Two men in pain...

164
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,635
Shall we drink then?

165
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,303
Cheers!

166
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,607
I'm home!

167
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,077
Grandpa?

168
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,681
Grandpa!

169
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,952
Are you in the store, Grandpa?

170
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,921
What are you doing?

171
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,271
Grandpa...

172
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,745
Look at her...

173
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:47,015
She was so little.

174
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:55,557
And now she's saying, "I'm getting married."

175
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,464
It's strange, isn't it?

176
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,670
It's so strange that it makes me cry.

177
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:47,540
As she looked at Katsutaro, Hitomi remembered what

178
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,810
they say about the father of the bride.

179
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,812
To be continued

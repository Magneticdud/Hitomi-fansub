CHAPTER 12
I Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 72

2
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,792
Tetsuo

3
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,795
What is it, Mom?

4
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,632
I'm going to stay here

5
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,603
I'm going to stay here
in the tenement

6
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:49,108
e everyone here is
more like my family

7
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,746
Sorry to bother you

8
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,489
Dear urry'

9
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,767
T4ie4iSn to party at Ume's house
turned into a disaster.

10
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,411
The next day

11
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,985
I'm sorry to call you all
of a sudden like this

12
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,786
I was surprised

13
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,756
Is it about yesterday?

14
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,927
AluallyrTr a little
regretful abt) t whit

15
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,330
kt^UJ?. Jj"1'
have<g ne4oo far

16
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,834
It has nothing to do with
the shopping mall.

17
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,302
I've already given
up that idea

18
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,471
No... I was being
childish..

19
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,906
I'm sorry

20
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,910
I'm actually happy you said
those things to me

21
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,880
I just wanted someone to
hear how I feel right now

22
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,117
How you feel?

23
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,687
I thought you might
understand the best

24
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,493
I felt as though we were
in the same position.

25
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,062
Considering your relationship
with your father

26
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,767
And you left, and abandoned
Tsukishima once, too..

27
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,407
To be honest, there was a
time when I looked down

28
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,943
on Makoto's way of life.

29
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,347
He had no sense
of adventure

30
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,449
He just stayed shut up in
his own little world

31
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,152
in Tsukishima.

32
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,921
When ! was in high school,
that's how all of the

33
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,857
merchants along the
shopping street were.

34
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,660
I thought it was
a bonne life

35
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,530
I understand. I felt
that way, too

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,434
That's why I wanted to
succeed in the big

37
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,737
world outside of
Tsukishima

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,241
I thought my mom
would be happy

39
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,479
But when I came back during
the festival, I felt like

40
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,986
a stranger when I heard the
sound of the Tsukuda Festival

41
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,356
Then I thought I didn't
belong there anymore.

42
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,625
I just stayed away

43
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,663
I feel the same way.

44
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,898
I still can't go to
the festivals

45
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,569
That's why, out of stubborn
pride, I tried thinking

46
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,607
that what I have now is
better than Tsukishima

47
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,312
And I wanted to ask my mom
why she was still clinging

48
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,981
to a place like that

49
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,551
Yesterday, I said it was
for the sake of mom's

50
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,021
happiness, but that
was a lie

51
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,857
It's my go

52
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,930
On the taxi home, I had an
argument with my wife.

53
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,967
When I complained about
the way she disciplined

54
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,002
Takeshi, she told me
How can you say

55
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,172
anything when you haven't
done anything?

56
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,141
She was so angry

57
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,777
I couldn't handle it, so
I got out of the taxi

58
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,413
before we got home

59
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,415
stopped at a bar, and
I drank myself under

60
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,417
the table

61
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,855
What my mom said as I was
leaving just kept going

62
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,225
around and around
in my head.

63
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,897
That the people in the
tenement were more of

64
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,733
a family to her

65
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,805
I knew t. sat

66
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,843
H ouidn't ake
a real fanfily

67
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,016
She told frie what I had
known all along.

68
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,855
That's when I finally
remembered that

69
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,458
I was raised in
that tenement.

70
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,329
Katsutaro and Yujiro used
to scold me as if I were

71
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,202
their real son... And they
really worried about me.

72
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,340
I used to love festivals.

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,643
I was proud of my mom's
inari sushi

74
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:26,385
Why couldn't I make
a real family?

75
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,592
I got depressed
as I drank

76
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,530
When I couldn't get any
more depressed, I went

77
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,800
home, and I became defiant.

78
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,370
I'm going to do things
the way I want even

79
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,706
if I have to fight
with my wife

80
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,544
That's all... Thank you
for listening to me

81
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,379
Tetsuo's declaration

82
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,716

Thank you

88
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,470
Whether it's mother and
son, or father and

89
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,474
daughter, parents and
children are really

90
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:28,180
bad at expressing their
feelings, aren't they?

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,852
If it weren't for being
embarrassed and stubborn

92
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,521
pride, the parents and
children of this world

93
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,624
would be so happy

94
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,529
Don't you agree?

95
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,898
I do

96
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,169
See you

97
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,313
What's wrong?

98
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,852
Do you remember Tetsuo?
Ume's son

99
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,155
The one who left
Tsukishima...?

100
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:45,991
I heard all about it.

101
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,926
You had a fight
with him?

102
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,098
Today, he told me that
he wasn't able to

103
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,800
make a real family.

104
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,441
That's why he's going
to try all over again

105
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,411
diieu i, I ^IbUO b
Declaration"

106
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,080
Was he just trying
to get back at me?

107
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,817
Do you want another?
My treat.

108
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,120
I'd better not

109
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,689
I don't want to cause
trouble for you again

110
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,391
Don't worry
about it

111
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,793
Go ahead and
get drunk

112
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,895
There are days

113
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,531
Thanks

114
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,525
When 11 la Grandpa
about that, he

115
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,927
Was happy... But he got
embarrassed wheril said

116
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,696
you were his
daughter, after all

117
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,830
That's not true..

118
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,832
He was probably
laughing inside.

119
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,635
That old man's always
laughing like that.

120
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,338
Excuse me

121
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,173
Takeshi?

122
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,943
Go on, Takeshi

123
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,379
Say it really loud.

124
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,516
The other day, I broke
the planter but

125
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,387
I blamed it on Shota.
I'm sorry I lied

126
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,556
I'm really sorry

127
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,161
Shota..

128
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,330
Takeshi..

129
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,300
Shall we shake to
show that there's

130
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,836
no hard feelings?

131
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,404
Put your hand out

132
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,875
Youw nt hoi
t now, will yoOi?

133
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,915
He went and apologized
to Makoto, too

134
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,717
My wife told me
not to, but

135
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,886
I convinced her

136
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,990
I talked to Takeshi for
over an hour

137
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,626
It's the first time we
talked that much.

138
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,129
Letqcrfh Yi

139
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,964
Sorry to bother you

140
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,242
Mom?

141
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,444
What is it?

142
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,112
Go on...

143
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,149
I'm sorry t i H he
food you made the

144
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,351
other day, Grandma

145
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,954
I'm sorry I p!ayed my game
while we were eating.

146
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,091
It's OK

147
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,227
We'd better be going.

148
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,096
Already?

149
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,433
We'll come back..

150
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,502
After we become a
real family.

151
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,808
Let's go.

152
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,145
Everyone!

153
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,915
Today is special.

154
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,584
After the fireworks are
over, go back to your

155
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,052
bed quietly

156
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,653
Yes ma'am

157
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,193
You have a nice view
from here, don't you?

158
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,229
We look forward to it
every summer

159
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,337
Good evening

160
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,072
Momoko?

161
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,341
Momoko, What are
you doing here?

162
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,343
I came to see how
you're doing

163
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,644
I was in the
neighborhood

164
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,513
You don't have to
be so surprised

165
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,648
It's a surprise to me when
you come to see me

166
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,650
Don't talk as if
I'm a ghost

167
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,819
Sit over there

168
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,422
Good evening

169
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,525
Good evening, Aunty

170
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,060
He called you "Aunty"

171
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,263
Stop it

172
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,072
That's really nice.

173
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,176
It would be great if I had
a beer right now

174
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,678
Don't ask for the moon...
This is a hospital

175
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,815
How are you feeling?

176
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,851
Not bad. I don't
feel any pain

177
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,986
Really?

178
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,355
How's your work
coming along?

179
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,457
I'm doing my best.

180
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,026
It's really hard though

181
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,761
That comes with
any job

182
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,565
Thank you for that

183
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,535
The towel you gave me
when you came to visit

184
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,471
I use it to wipe my
sweat all the time

185
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,208
I bought that in a rush,
so next time, I'll bring

186
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,976
you a better one

187
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,078
That was good enough

188
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,390
After all that happened,
it seems father and

189
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,227
daughter are getting a
little closer now

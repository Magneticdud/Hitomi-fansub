About what ^

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,714

i mum i... one 5a iai
bloomer, so I thought

115
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,582
she wouldn't find
^boyfriend

116
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,485
ut fromwhat 1 could see,
he didn't seem like

117
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,421
her boyfriend yet

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,024
lore like admiration for a
more experienced dancer.

119
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,292
That's true

120
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,294
t would gro ntd
a deeper relation flip

00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,029
from there.

122
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,399

It's true that I want
KEN to dance

181
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,462
I think it'll be
good for him

182
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,731
Dance is all he has

183
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,702
That's why I got him to
ome ack from New York,

184
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,472
grid h p with the choreography
or the promotion video,

185
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,974
nd work with the dancers.

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,711
I anted him to get back
up on the stage again

187
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,284
Unfortunately, it's not going
as well as i thought

188
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,055

I occ

189
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,129
m sorry... I'm going*o
work on it a little more

190
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,398
I'm sorry for
interrupting.

191
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,369
RAY said she wanted J\EN
to dance again, but...

192
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,106
So the problem is
KEN's feelings

193
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,278
Does it mean tnai he can t
dan e without EIJP

194
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,247
That's how perfect
h irunit as.

195
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,486
EN hasn't danced on sta e
or irete ears..

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,323
it sho-vs how big EIJI's
oss \ as to EN.

197
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,826
That'-s true

198
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,997
don t you want to
KEN nd HAY an e?

199
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,302

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,896
Hitomi went to have monja
with Ken in Tsukishima.

6
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,107
Good evening

7
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,343
Are you celebrating again?

8
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,479
\hidi ^ nyiii... ^v^ yui
another client.

9
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,582
You're really doing well,
aren't you, Momoko?

10
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,684
Let's call Hitomi.

11
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,019
We should all call her

12
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,555
Hitomi's already coming
With her boyfriend.

13
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,990
Boyfriend?

14
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,426
Someone's already here
Check it out

15
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,931
Does Hitomi have
a boyfriend?

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,168
I don't know their
relationship status, but

17
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,505
he's a customer at the
diner, and they were

18
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,807
enjoying talking to each
other this afternoon

19
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,675
What is he like?

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,644
I he one of the
guys in Tsukiji?

21
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,779
If he was, I'd
happy for her, but

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,982
he's a good-looking
dancer

23
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,783
A good-looking dancer?

24
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,457
Hitomi!

25
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,591


26
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,161
We're having a company
drinking party

27
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,695
Good evening.

28
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,431
We just happened
to be here

29
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,133
A likely story

30
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,435
Who is he?

31
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,873
This is Ken. He gives me
advice about dancing and

32
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,142
comes to the diner
once in a while

33
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,811
Pleased to meet you
I'm Suzuki

34
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,481
Your name is Suzuki?

35
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,083
Common, isn't it?

36
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,121
Is that right?

37
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,490
I'm Hitomi's mother...

38
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,492
Hitomi says shes's
indebted to you

39
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,093
My pleasure

40
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,462
We have something to
talk about today

41
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,965
I see! Just for the
two of you

42
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,233
Come on in.

43
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,309
I like him! Is Hitomi
going out with him?

44
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,677
Probably

45
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,978
He's wonderful!

46
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,347
Hitomi's not doing
too badly

47
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,190
It's good, isn't it?

48
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,192
Isn't it?

49
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,928
Our ^oup bl! s
different..

50
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,297
of iff ffent va ie les

51
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,466
Thanks

52
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,669
What did you want
to ask me?

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,441
It's about Dance Beat.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,913
I heard a rumor that you
and Ray were going to

55
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,514
enter it this year.

56
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,717
new about the rumor.

57
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,885
Are you really
going to enter?

58
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,488
I want to see you
and Ray dance.

59
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,558
I'm happy to hear
that,

60
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,027
but I don't know

61
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,396
Why?

62
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,767
Because CHEAPASS

63
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,937
belonged to
three of us

64
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,110
hld^j1V

65
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,946

Yid he ibl3 RA ot to

67
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,487
UJH\J:hi

68
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,522
I see...

69
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,961
That's pretty heavy..

70
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,663
It doesn't
match monja

71
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,965
I'm sorry

72
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,771
I Ijl i

73
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,984
Thank you

74
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,952
It was delicious

75
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,254
Come again.

76
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,490
Next time let's have a
leisurely meal together.

77
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,192
You don't have
to say that.

78
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,161
But you're indebted
to him, aren't you?

79
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,263
I'm going to see him off

80
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,132
Why don't you Xdki a e o r
and show him around?

81
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,001
You don't have to
worry about us

82
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,170
OK, let's go.

83
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,338
Goodbye

84
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,614
Did you see that?
Isn't he great?

85
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,216
I have to give
Hitomi credit!

86
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,185
He's good-looking,
isn't he?

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,053
He's legendary

88
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,756
There are some cool
guys here in Tokyo.

89
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,858
I agree

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,561
I wonder about that.
I don't think so.

91
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,996
He s just putting on airs

92
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,833
He probably thinks the
silent type is cool

93
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,901
But he just doesn't have
anything to say

94
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,070
By any chance, are you
in love with Hitomi?

95
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,605
Are you?

96
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,040
It's not like that..

97
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,975
It's the neighborly
thing to do to

98
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,710
make sure she's not hooking
up with some weird guy

99
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,779
Then you should be glad
it's someone like him.

100
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,647
I'll have you know that
ol a lot stranger

101
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,049
than he is.

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,786
Why are you all agreeing
with her, Sapporo team?

103
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,323
Is this where you
were, Yuzo?

104
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,058
Mr ishidas gry

105
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,459
You just disappeared

106
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,727
Get off my bat**

107
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,028
Are you my dad's shadow?

108
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,930
Let's go! We want
to go home already.

109
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,432
All right! I'm coming

110
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,567
Put it on my tab, Mako.

111
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,635
All right

112
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,976
I'm so relieved

113
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,278
About what?

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,714
Hitomi... one 5a late
bloomer, so I thought

115
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,582
she wouldn't find
a boyfriend

116
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,485
But from what I saw,
he didn't seem like

117
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,421
her boyfriend yet

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,024
More like admiration for a
more experienced dancer.

119
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,292
That's true

120
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,294
It would grow into
a deeper relationship

121
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,029
from there.

122
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,399
I wish it would
work out for her

123
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,540
I can find my way to
the station from here

124
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,543
Thank you for today

125
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm sorry for asking
such a strange question

126
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,018


127
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,289
Everyone really wants o
see you and Ray dance

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,324
up on the stage again.

129
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,329
I told you before that
dance is life, didn't I?

130
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,033
You did.

131
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,436
That's what it is.

132
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,074
Do your best with
ROSE MARY.

133
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,678
I will... Good night

134
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,580
Good night

135
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,433
Thank you for
everything

136
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,601
Not at all

137
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,835
Take care

138
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,637
Good night.

139
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,539
Make sure you 15th won't
catch his cold...

140
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,474
I can't have you
a in timeo

141
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,575
on i ^vorry'

142
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,313
Yuzo

143
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,316
Sit over here

144
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,686
What is it?

145
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,756
I've been in business
since I was 8 ears 19..

146
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,158
It's been 5 ears n

147
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,428
4 started h rie
business, managed employees

148
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,533
and increased 
of regular customers

149
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,868
I feel)' e o
veil s nan.

150
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,538
Wh \ .g o
r ing Ao a

151
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,140
That's why I want you to
hurry and get the people

152
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,777
in Tsukiji to trust you, and
become a full-fledged man.

153
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:12,584
Getting you to become a
respectable man and

154
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,321
have you take over
Ishida Shoten is

155
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,725
the last big job
I have left

156
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,497
Don't forget that

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,676
So Ken's feelings are
still a mystery.

158
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,782
All I know is that it isn't
t "St sirrii 1e for Ken

159
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,850
to dance again

160
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,788
We don't have to work
today, so shall we

161
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,023
have a meeting about
our costumes?

162
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,992
Where shall we have it?

163
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,560
Shall we go
to my place?

164
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,429
Can you come, Hitomi?

165
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,632
I'll ask Grandpa first,
but I think it's OK

166
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,933
Let's go then

167
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,369
I'm sorry... I forgot my
towel, so can I meet

168
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,371
you all later?

169
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,239
Be careful

170
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,117
I didn't know you
were still here

171
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,158
I'm sorry... I was just
so fascinated

172
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,860
Excuse me..

173
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,796
What is it?

174
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,001
Are you and Kne going
to enter Dance Beat?

175
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,271
Who told you that?

176
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,741
Well...

177
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,711
That's OK...

178
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,714
The answer right
now is "no"

179
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,117


180
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,856
It's true that I want
Ken to dance

181
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,462
I think it'll be
good for him

182
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,731
Dance is all he has

183
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,702
That's why I got him to
come back from New York,

184
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,472
grid help with the choreography
or the promotion video,

185
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,974
and work with the dancers.

186
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,711
I wanted him to get back
up on the stage again

187
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,284
Unfortunately, it's not going
as well as I thought

188
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,055
I occ

189
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,129
I'm sorry... I'm going to
work on it a little more

190
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,398
I'm sorry for
interrupting.

191
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,369
Ray said she wanted Ken
to dance again, but...

192
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,106
So the problem is
Ken's feelings

193
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,278
Does it mean that he can't
dance without Eiji?

194
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,247
That's how perfect
their unit sas.

195
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,486
Ken hasn't danced on stage
for eight ears..

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,323
It shows how big Eiji's
loss is to Ken.

197
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,826
That's true

198
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,997
But don't you want to see
Ken and Ray dance?

199
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,302
As a dancer, I'd like to see
those two dance again.

200
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,371
When Ken and Ray danced
OCKS V.at time, it was

201
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,540
really terrific,
wasn't it?

202
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,975
I want to see it.

203
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,376
I do, too

204
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,945
Wait a minute!

205
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,015
If they're really going
to enter Dance Beat,

206
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,051
Ken and Ray will
be our rivals!

207
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,653
We have o in it

208
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,822
I'm going to do my best
so we j/vin it fo ue

209
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,191
It's your revenge,
isn't it, Hitomi?

210
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,160
That's right. I couldn't
enter last year, so this

211
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,229
will be my revenge

212
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,899
We have no choice
We have to do it

213
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,301
This time, unless we put
5Qt 120 percent, we won't

214
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,502
be able to win

215
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,504
hen ei sput" MX
20 percent.

216
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:38,910
Let's aim or$J20 W:ent,
and do our best!

217
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,678
We'll do our best.

218
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,255
All Hitomi and the others
could think about right

219
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,357
now was Dance Beat

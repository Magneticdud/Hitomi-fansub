Music by
YAMASHITA Kosuke

4
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,374
They put together an awesome
group for their part-time

5
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,009
job as Mayuge Neko

6
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,382
Hello

7
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,355
You sure are full
of energy!

8
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,994
You'll be even more
energetic after this...

9
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,630
What gives you
energy isn't the

10
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,334
Maneki Neko but
the "Mayuge Neko"

11
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,772
Here are the Mayuge Neko!

12
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
Thank you!

13
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,467
It's over!

14
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,604
The children really
liked it

15
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,706
It doesn't happen
that often.

16
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,441
It was great!

17
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,543
It was the best Mayuge
Neko performance yet

18
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,679
Thank you so much.

19
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,616
Well done!

20
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,620
Please come back again
if we have something

21
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,687
The bonus, dear

22
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,523
I added a bonus for your
great performance

23
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,125
Lucky!

24
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,827
We have to clean up.

25
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,996
I'll bring the car
so wait right here.

26
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,398
Thank you.

27
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,071
Thank you so much,
Ken and Ray!

28
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,707
Not at all...
It was fun

29
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,743
Thank you.

30
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,578
I don't think I would have
enjoyed something

31
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,413
like this before. 
I guess I feel a

32
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,881
little freer now

33
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,521
I enjoyed today, too

34
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,256
I made up my mind.

35
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,724
About what?

36
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,093
I'm going to work

37
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,796
To train all
over again.

38
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,399
Does that mean

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,968
that you're going to
dance on stage again?

40
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,474
I wasn't sure, but
I made up my mind.

41
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,743
This made me realize that
there s still something

42
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,079
more I can do up
on stage.

43
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,815
So I'm going to try
it on my own..

44
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,717
Away from Chi-pass.

45
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,954
I'll believe in my own
dancing, and polish it

46
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,490
That's so cool, Ray

47
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,193
Do your best

48
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,896
Good luck

49
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,066
What about you, Ken?

50
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,370
I don't know... But for now,
I'll sell dried bonito

51
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,173
Dried bonito, huh?

52
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,476
I'll do my best

53
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:45,877
Do your best!

54
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,987
Aren't you glad that your
homeroom teacher is

55
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,456
Mr. Fujita, Yuria?

56
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,391
He alread n
iDxiJn^

57
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,026
jSf^ jiy
his regards. Akira..

58
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,463
Give him my regards, too
He's a really good teacher

59
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,132
He really is.. After -when
Akira purposely got

60
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:12,771
zeroes on his exams, he
really was worried.

61
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,741
I won't get zeroes.

62
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,876
Don't bring that
up already

63
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,883
Hitomi

64
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,955
You've been really quiet today
Ever since dinner

65
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,860
Didn't Mayuge Neko
go well today?

66
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,795
Did you make a mistake?

67
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,564
It went really well.

68
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,433
Did it?

69
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,568
Are you just tired, then?

70
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,437
It's been a while
since you danced

71
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,205
jlrvihat 6£fe, y I should
take a bath and just

72
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,707
go to sleep.

73
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,678
Are you home, Katsu?

74
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,646
I'm here

75
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,182
You're here, too, Hitomi.

76
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,851
After you eat, let's go.

77
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,753
We finished.
We were just resting

78
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,188
If you're finished,
then let's go.

79
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,289
To Matsuri?

80
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,424
Very perceptive

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,592
That's about the only
thing you do anyway

82
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,597
What is it you wanted?

83
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,500
We wanted to talk to
you about things.

84
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,468
Like Hitomi..

85
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,872
I wonder what Hitomi's
going to do now

86
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,841
Didn't she say she was
going to dance for

87
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,876
a part-time job?
Ken went, too

88
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,213
I thought that was
a good idea

89
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,081
It's a good way to
relieve stress

90
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,650
Good evening!

91
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,554
What are you
doing here?

92
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,958
Yujiro asked me to come

93
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,893
He said he wanted to talk
with me about Hitomi...

94
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,829
Did you call her, Yu?

95
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,830
IJUt

96
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,698
We want to drink
with you and Momoko.

97
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,869
We thought it was a good
chance for the two of you

98
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,038
When I saw the two of you
putting your heads together

99
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,373
because you were worried
about Hitomi, I thought

100
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,276
it was time the two
got back to

101
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,912
being a normal father
and daughter again

102
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,181
Isn't it about time you
started iSfkihp to each

103
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,417
other like any ordinary
father and daughter?

104
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,585
Have a seat, Hitomi

105
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,653
Sit down Momoko

106
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,456
Right here

107
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,260
What would you
like to drink?

108
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,931
I have a bottle
right here, Mari

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,234
That's right

110
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,435
Here you go

111
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,070
I'm going to pour

112
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,638
Thank you.

113
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,444
Thanks for what you
did for Hitomi

114
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,112
Hitomi said she learned
a lot from working

115
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,047
at your place

116
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,824

Thank you! Thank you!

j} 3 3 hi }}


121
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,684
You think I don't
know that!

122
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,186
I probably know more
than you do

123
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,121
What are you saying?

124
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,357
She and I were together
for 20 years!

125
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,492
She's only been with
you for a year!

126
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,361
What are you saying?

127
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,129
Now, now

128
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,566
We know that you both
care about Hitomi, so

129
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,102
get back to what you
were talking about

130
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,706
About what Hitomi should
do from now on

131
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,741
Jiat' oghts
tfiscu ..

132
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,443
That's true

133
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,878
If there's something
Hitomi can get enthusiastic

134
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,047
about  anSTget iifoit,
a decides that she

135
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,751
wants to do it, then I
don't care what it is.

136
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,053
After all, she's serious

137
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,254
And cheerful..

138
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,689
She has leadership
qualities, too.

139
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,024
She takes after me.

140
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,993
She gets that
from me

141
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,395


142
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,763
Calm down

143
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,698
Say something, Mari

144
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,001



145
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,068

148

I'm home!

149
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,567
Good evening

150
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:10,902
Mom!

151
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,537
You were together?

152
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,407
We were together with
Yujiro at Matsuri.

153
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,343
How nice that you're
getting along

154
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:19,978
Have a seat

155
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,048
Are you two going
to talk?

156
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,716
I'll just go
upstairs then

157
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,251
Wait a minute

158
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,520
We want to talk to you

159
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,689
Sit over there, Hitomi

160
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,690
Me

161
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:41,800
Momoko and I were
just talking...

162
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:48,306
You really have a lot
of good qualities

163
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:53,912
I'm not saying that you
should work in an office

164
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,582
You can decide whatever
you want to do, but

165
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,885
If that's what this
is about then..

166
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,154
I want to keep dancing,
after all

167
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,993
I realized today that
I need to dance

168
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,498
I realized it when I went
to do that part-time

169
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,967
job dancing as
Mayuge Neko

170
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,703
You told me, didn't
you Mom.. ?

171
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,106
That you could work harder
because people would

172
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,041
say, Thank you

173
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,645
The children really
enjoyed our dancing

174
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,616
And a lot of them
thanked us

175
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,653
I was really happy.

176
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,626
I still don't know what
form it'll take, but

177
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,095
I'm going to continue
dancing

178
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,801
I'll find something so that
it's not just for my

179
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,503
own seif-satisfaction

180
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,307
Isn't that making
progress.. ?

181
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,109
Just getting to
this point

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,413
Good night

183
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,116
Good night.

184
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,596
I guess we'll just have to
wait and see for a while

185
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,332
Since Hitomi says she's
making progress

186
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,334
I guess so

187
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,937
There's no use pushing
her too hard

188
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,911
Momoko.. I heard
you're working hard

189
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,647
Hitomi told me

190
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,949
That you're really
working super hard

191
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,952
It's just that
we're busy

192
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,488
We don't have too
many employees

193
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,792
That's an added burden
for you, so be sure

194
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,061
to take care of
yourself

195
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,765
Thank you

196
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,937
I'll talk to you if
anything happens.

197
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,371
If anything happens.

198
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,779
Momoko

199
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,447
Be careful

200
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,751
Looking for a way 
to continue

201
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,821
dancing in a way
that fit her

202
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,589
gave Hitomi the
feeling that she

203
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,224
had taken a step in
a new direction

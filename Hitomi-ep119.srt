dancing

178
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,801
I'll find something so that
it's not just for my

179
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,503
own seif-satisfaction

180
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,307
Isn't that making
progress.. ?

181
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,109
Just getting to
this point

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,413
Good night

183
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,116
Good flight.

184
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,596
! guess we'll just have to
wait and see for a while

185
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,332
Since Hitomi says she's
making progress

186
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,334
I guess so

187
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,937
There's no use pushing
her too hard

188
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,911
Vlomoko.. i =eard
you re working hard

189
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,647
Hitomi t 1d me

190
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,949
That you're really
working super hard

191
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,952
A s just that
we're busy

192
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,488
We don t have too
many employees

193
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,792
That's an added "burden
for you, so be sure

194
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,061
to take careDf
yourself

195
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,765
Thank you

196
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,937
Ill talk to you if
anything happens.

197
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,371
If anything happens.

198
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,779
Momoko

199
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,447
Be careful

200
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,751
Looking for a way that
she could continue

201
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,821
dancing in a way hat
was suited to her

202
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,589
That gave Hitomi the
feeling that he

203
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,224
Jiad taken a step in
a new directi n

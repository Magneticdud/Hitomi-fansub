We were all going in
different directions.

58
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,675
But Hitomi got us all
to come together

59
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:33,018
I said I was going io
do it alone, but

60
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,688
eforfe I knew it, the three or
us were dancing together

When the three of us

65
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,207
I feel like dancing
is so much fun

66
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
It makes me happy

67
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,906
it's such ** aste...

68
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
It s really a waste

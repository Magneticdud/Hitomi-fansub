We're not going to
enter Dance Beat.

00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,699
Let's disband
ROSE MARY

7
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,274
I'll do my best on my
entrance exams, so

8
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,809
don't give up, Hitomi!

Keppare!

11
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,961
Shall I try my best?

Hello! This is Hitomi!

16
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:56,408
I thought about what you
said last night, but..

17
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,044
I'm ROSE MARY's leader.

18
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,980
In other words, unless
at ROSE MARY

19
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,816
e is Of nded,

to be disbanded

20
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm not giving up until
the deadline, so

21
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,821
I'm counting on you!

22
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,723
See you!

23
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,127
That was great, Leader!

00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,396

25
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,844

Hitomi

33
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,659
It looks like you
need me here

34
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,028
I'll practice
with you

35
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,563
You will?

36
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,100
That dance move you were just
doing was pretty good.

37
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,501
Teach me how to do that

38
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,136
The move I just did?

39
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,011
Got it

40
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,282
Like this.

Come on...Do it

43
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,944
There you go

44
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,114
That's it

45
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,732

Oka Yuria, sixth grade,
Group one

00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,922
Everyone was doing their best
at what they had to do

49
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,788
Junko, Yuka.

50
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,292
Did you get the message
from Hitomi saying that

51
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,229
ROSE MARY won't be disbanded
until she says so?

52
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,766
We heard it.

53
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,068
It's up to her

54
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,206

57
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,104
We were all going in
different directions.

58
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,675
But Hitomi got us all
to come together

59
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:33,018
I said I was going io
do it alone, but

60
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,688
Before I knew it, the three of
us were dancing together

61
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,158
She knew how to get us
together, didn't she?

62
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,060
Hitomi's great

63
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,831
That's what I like about

64
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,136
When the three of us
dance together

65
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,207
I feel like dancing
is so much fun

66
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
It makes me happy

67
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,906
It's really a waste

68
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
It's really a waste

69
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,743
sffttt

70
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,778
You were great at the
Summer Contest

71
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,214
But I don't know how
to convince them

72
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,383
Then let's practice

73
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:44,155
Think of me as Junko,
and Daisuke m a

74
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,591
And tr o-come p ifi
what you wa> 1 to say.

75
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,293
That's a go lea.

76
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,937
I can't think
of anything.

77
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,706
Shall we try changing
roles then?

78
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,942
Maybe we're standing in
the wrong position.

79
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,310
That's not the problem

80
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,479
Daisuke's Junko, and
^suke's Yuka

81
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
That's not it

82
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,551

What are you having today?

86
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,164
Miso mackerel..

87
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,933
One miso mackerel!

88
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,701

Thanks

94
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,351
He makes me so mad.
He's too cool

95
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,420
Don't worry

96
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,357
Thank you for waiting.
Here's your miso mackerel.

97
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,092
Thank you.

98
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,634
What's wrong?

99
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,205
You came here before,
didn't you?

100
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,241
It was delicious, so I
came again today

101
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,577
Thank you.

102
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,380
By any chance...

103
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,350
What is it?

104
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,556
It's KEN

It's been three years

00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,654
it seems like time has
stopped for KEN

115
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,359
By any chance, did you
go to Harumi Pier?

116
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,697

120
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,612
When I have something to
think about, I go to

121
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,014
Harumi Pier to look
at the ocean

122
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,983
When I p e here that
time, I was on my way

123
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,418
back from there.

124
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,921
And I'm thinking of going
there again today

125
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,333


126
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,607
A number of my friends
quit dancing because

127
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,610
of money problems and 
family circumstances

128
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,648

130
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,419
all dancing means to them.

131
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,358
But I wouldn't say

132
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,731
those are the ones who
can be good dancers.

133
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,034
Why is that?

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,572
You don't just dance
up on the stage.

135
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,476
You're not showing your
technique, but yourself

136
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,680
Technique is only the
method you use to

137
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,849
express yourself.

138
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,120
Someone who doesn't run away,
who comes face-to-face with

139
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,357
having doubts and
suffering hardships..

140
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,191
If you still want to
dance after all that,

141
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:45,964

142
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:51,336
You're sure to dance
your very best

143
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,207
Dance is life.

144
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,326
Saturday

145
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,494

146
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,076
Hitomi... The deadline
is tomorrow.

147
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,679
What are you going to do?

148
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,484
I'm going to convince them

149
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,123
Hitomi!

150
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,475
Yuka! Junko!
Are you home?

151
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,247
Oh, it's you

152
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,549
Keiichi?

153
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,352
I'm here on business, so
I thought I'd stop

154
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,487
and convince Junko to
give up dancing.

CHAPTER 12
Can't Go to the Festival
Episode 69

2
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,158
I'm worried about you.

3
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,461
I don't want anything to
happen to you while

4
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,062
you're living all alone.

5
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,198
It's a given this kind
of thing will happen...

6
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,400
Bothering our
neighbors like this.

7
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,503
We have a room for you

8
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,805
It'll be a lot easier
for you than living

9
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,440
here in the tenement

10
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,609
I don't want to

11
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,044
No matter what anyone
says, I love it here

12
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,946
in the tenement

13
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,149
Just go home already
You'll raise my fever

14
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,588
I'll leave for today

15
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,089
But I'm coming back

16
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,026
I'll leave this here - a melon.

17
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,863
I don't want your melon.

18
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,233
It cost $100, you know!

19
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,971
It looks like Ume's son Tetsuo
came to talk

20
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,673
Ume into coming to
live with him

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,217
Don't you have more
to say to her?

22
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,154
I better go home, given
what she said

23
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,055
I'm sorry you had
to hear that

24
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,724
It's okay

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,792
Since you're here, can't we
talk some more before

26
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,294
you go home?

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,130
I want to hear more about
that shopping mall, too

28
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,233
How about going over
to Makoto's place?

29
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,502
We can have beer
and monja

30
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,238
Monja? Sounds good
Shall we go?

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,806
Let's go

32
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,009
Mom! I'm going home!

33
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,178
Hitomi! Take care
of Ume

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,513
Okay
Let's go.

35
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,564
Hitomi

36
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,266
Let the children
eat the melon

37
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,269
Is that OK?

38
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,049
It's ready,
isn't it?

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,916
Here goes

40
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,027
Yum

41
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,696
It's really good

42
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,664
Monja is the best

43
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,800
Of course, it's
Tsukishima's specialty

44
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,870
Tetsuo...when was that,
the New Year's when you

45
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,707
brought your wife and
kid over here?

46
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,543
When we ran into each other

47
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,146
The time when I wanted to
eat monja, and my wife

48
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,717
said "We're going to a
restaurant in Ginza."

49
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,319
That's right, that was it.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,288
Why didn't you push a little
more to get your wife

51
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,459
to stay and have monja

52
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,094
I was waiting for you to
tell her that you were

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,929
a Tsukishima man, and
want to eat "monja"

54
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,964
And she should eat
it too!

55
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,432
There's no way around it

56
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,101
My wife just doesn't have
any understanding of

57
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,003
what common
people eat.

58
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,805
It's not like it's 
substandard!

59
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,142
What do you eat at home -- 
French and Italian cuisine?

60
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,711
Something like that.

61
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,648
My wife loves to cook,
so I promised to come

62
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,884
home to eat dinner at
home every night

63
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,853
She's going to make me
eat dinner when I get

64
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,021
home today, too.

65
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,455
If she finds out that
I ate something like

66
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,890
this, there'll be
a big fuss

67
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,558
I wonder if she'll
smell it on me!

68
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,261
I guess it's OK.

69
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,363
She's the. daughter of a
company director, isn't she?

70
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,165
He was, but now he's 
retired, so he's not

71
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,867
connected with the company
anymore.

72
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,869
When we built our house, he 
paid the deposit 

73
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,937
without hesitation. So I try 
to keep him happy

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,008
You've changed, Tetsuo...

75
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,679
You were never like
this before

76
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,081
What was I like?

77
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,117
We used to play pranks
together all the time

78
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,119
On Katsu, too.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Like what?

80
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,823
That was before we got
to middle school

81
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,792
While Katsu was in the
bathroom, we changed

82
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,960
the prices on the
shirts in the store

83
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,929
That's right. I remember

84
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,398
We changed them to $1000
or $10,000.

85
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,300
What a thing to do.

86
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,736
When he found out,
he got really mad

87
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,371
He sure did

88
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,139
Katsu's really scary
when he's angry.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,775
You really see steam
rising from his head

90
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,745
He lectured us until
we cried

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,748
He really lit into us.

92
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,550
He said, "What would
happen if customers

93
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,685
really paid $10,000?"

94
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,957
If I got a $10,000
for a $30 shirt,

95
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,592
that would be fraud!

96
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,761
Do you want people
to call me a fraud?

97
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,863
Did you hear me?

98
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,931
Makoto!

99
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,965
Tetsuo!

100
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,838
We're sorry

101
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,608


102
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,245
But that's the kind of
friends we used to be.

103
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,884
You used to love festivals
when you were a kid.

104
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,553
You promised that we would
carry the portable shrine

105
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,489
when we grew up..

106
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,526
But you don't even manage
to watch the festivals

107
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,063
**If you're drunk,
maybe you'll do it?**

108
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,664
You had too much
to drink, Makoto.

109
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:40,799
I'm sorry, Tetsuo

110
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,834
That's just the way it is

111
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,036
What is?

112
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,407
That's the path I chose

113
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,877
Unlike you, I wanted to
get out of Tsukishima

114
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,113
I wanted to become a
success in something

115
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,349
in the big world 
outside of Tsukishima

116
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,385
I thought my mom would
be happy if I did

117
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,688
But the plan
didn't work that way

118
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,257
No matter how much 
success or how

119
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,628
big a house I have, it
doesn't please my mom

120
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,964
That's the source
of my troubles.

121
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,177
He wasn't a bad kid
to from the start.

122
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:32,150
He studied hard, so
he could make me happy

123
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,588
He got into a good company

124
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,192
and married a young lady
from a rich family.

125
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,962
But from about that time
we couldn't agree

126
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,831
on anything...

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,336
I don't think being rich
makes you important.

128
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,941
And I don't just because
you have a grand house,

129
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,642
you'll be happy.

130
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,547
But that's how he came
to think.

131
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:09,120
Maybe he had a hard time when
he went out into the world.

132
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,558
I just don't know

133
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,430
Maybe there's also 
some good parts.

134
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,634
Hitomi

135
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,907
I'm going to sleep now

136
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,344
Thank you.

137
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,749
Are you sure it's OK
for me to take this?

138
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,550
Are you sure it's OK
for me to take this?

139
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,587
You eat it for me.

140
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,625
Well then, thank you

141
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,994
Good night.

142
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,966
It wasn't that they truly
hated each other

143
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,339
Not being able to agree on
things, and different ways

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,009
of thinking create a chasm
between parent and child

145
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,596
A few days later

146
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,267
Ume had recovered.

147
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,273
Good morning, Hitomi

148
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,175
Ume! Are you okay?

149
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,678
Thanks to you. I'm even
better than before.

150
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,947
I'm so glad!

151
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,658
How did it go?

152
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,096
No good, huh?

153
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,434
I want to go back
to Sapporo.

154
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,371
Don't say things
like that!

155
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,273
Face forward,
face forward!

156
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,245
I'm back

157
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,682
Welcome bacK

158
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,789
Ms. Ippongi...

159
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,190
Yes

160
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,437
I'm getting an earful from
the head office

161
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,106
They want to know what
is going on in

162
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,675
the Tokyo office!

163
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,478
You have to do something
to get closer

164
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,614
to your sales goal!

165
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,450
Don't you get it? We
have to get more stores

166
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,085
to carry our products!

167
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,687
I'll make every effort.

168
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,292
It's making my
stomach hurt.

169
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,006
Are you alright?

170
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,443
I wish he wouldn't blame
his stomachache on me.

171
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,145
All he has to do is take
stomach medicine for it

172
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,186
Suzuran Cosmetics..
This is Ippongi.

173
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,456
Tetsuo..

174
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,946
Momo..

175
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,481
Tetsuo!

176
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,382
I'm sorry to be late when
I'm the one who called you

177
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,550
No worries, I was
happy you called

178
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,685
A coffee please.

179
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,120

180
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,321


181
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,659
Getting right to it, about
that new shopping center

182
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,362
I thought I'd tell you
about our products...

183
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,333
That's not what I came to
talk with you about today

184
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,570
Then what did you
want to talk about?

185
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,707
My mom got sick, didn't she?

186
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,710
So I thought now would be
a good time to convince

187
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,411
her to come and live
with us

188
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,914
her spirits are
weak right now, too

189
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,450
Maybe so, but...

190
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,353
So I need your help to
get my mom to lean

191
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,156
towards living with us.

192
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:12,991
Me?

193
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,793
If possible, Hitomi, too

194
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,895
Hitomi, too?

195
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,202
I'll think about space
in the shopping center

196
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,841
One Sunday soon, I think 
I'll bring my wife and son

197
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,810
to Tsukishima

198
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,479
I'll use the excuse of
celebrating her recovery

199
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,514
from her illness..

200
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,850
I'll order a super deluxe
portion of chirashi sushi

201
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,718
from a sushi shop and
we can eat together

202
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,986
in harmony

203
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,054
That sounds good.

204
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,556
Why don't you do that right away?

205
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,924
It won't be that smooth!

206
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,525
My mom hasn't ever
even let my wife

207
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,160
come into her house.

208
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,296
SO it's going to be really
hard just to get her to

209
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,997
agree to this arrangement.

210
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,365
Just to get her
to eat sushi?

211
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,466
That's right

212
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,569
So I want you to
help make it work

213
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,671
I guess I could do that

214
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,873
The main point is to

215
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,641
spend time in harmony 

216
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,877
We've never eaten a meal
together before, so

217
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,213
we probably won't 
have much to talk about

218
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,647
That's where you come in

219
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,982
Me and Hitomi?

220
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,384
Then I'll look for the
right timing to bring

221
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,421
up the subject of coming
to live with us.

222
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,890
Then I need you
to back me up

223
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,662
I'll think about the
tenant space

224
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,972
Mom, you agreed to it?

225
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,076
Of course..isn't it 
a good thing?

226
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,912
For a mother and son
to live together.

227
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,648
Don't decide that
on your own!

228
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,451
VVhy are you siding with
Tetsuo anyway?

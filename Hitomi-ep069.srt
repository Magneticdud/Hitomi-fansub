00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,964
That's fhe source
of my troubles.

121
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,177
He wasn't bad boy
to begin with.

122
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:32,150
Jte studied Vd, so
he could make me*hap y

196
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,841
I'm thinking of bringing

00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,479

Y^rfe^ilnrirrrv :;om

207
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,160

SO! S'goinatotte e ily
hard jus ^to g \ h r to

209
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,997
agree to this setting.

210
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,365

I guess J could do that

214
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,873
The main point is to
get to the harmonious

215
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,641
part f this whole thing

216
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,877
We've never eaten sushi
tbgether before, so

217
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,213
we probably won't have
rftuch to talk about

218
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,647
That where you come in

219
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,982

222
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,890
Then I need you
o back me up

223
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,662
I'll think about the
tenant space

An ou agreed to it?

225
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,076
Of course.. It's a good
thing, isn't it...?

226
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,912
For a mother arid son
to live together.

227
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,648
Don't|j tide (hat

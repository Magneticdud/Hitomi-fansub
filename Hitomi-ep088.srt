Shotas towel l^nket

Shota s rra. ing a big fuss

00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,086
You mean the towel blanket that
Shota treasured because

7
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,988
it held memories
of his moti^r..?

8

24
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,128
I thought it might be mixed
in with the laundry.

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,197
But! thought Shota had
put it away tn alDox

26
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,066
He did,;but

27
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,540
You're right! It's gone.

28
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,443
We looked everywhere
in this foom.

29
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,012
Betwe 7i the bedding, and
underlhe bed,-too.

30
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,714
Did he take it out
fromtiere?

31
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,682
He^aid lie did

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,285
After that time, he put it away
i Ihe box^nd o 1y looked

33
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,853

What are you doing?

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,766
I'm looking for Shota's
towel blanket.

39
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,601
I don't think it's here

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,137
When I hung out the laundry,
i didn't see it

41
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,873
It might have fallen out
here by mistake

42
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,108
Like the last time

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,790

What's this?

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,526
I don't know

52
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,868
Why did you hide it?

53
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,773
Because

54
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,675
you don't need
it anymore

55
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,511

Think really hard about
your feelings

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,569
Aren't you feeling lonely
because Shota might be

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,440
leaving this house?

65
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,580

I'm sorry... Really sorry

133

^e never old his mother
about Shota

138
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,542
She must ha\/e said some
harsh thingfe onsi e in

139
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,977
she's the owner of an old,
traditional restaur n

140
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,046
Wait a minute..

141
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,781

143
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,120
It doesn't have anything
to do with Shota, does it?

144
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,922
Even if his mother doesn't
get married she can

145
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,657
still take him back,
can't she?

146
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,259

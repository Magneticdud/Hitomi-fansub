CHAPTER 15
Tearstained Towel Blanket
Episode 88

2
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,007
Shota's towel blanket?

3
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,647
What's wrong?

4
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,116
Shota's towel blanket
is missing, and

5
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,751
Shota's making a big fuss

6
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,086
You mean the towel blanket that
Shota treasures because

7
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,988
it holds memories
of his mother..?

8
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,957
That's right

9
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,959
Hurry, and go. Don't
worry about us

10
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,961
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,396
I'd better go.

12
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,664
Thank you for the meal

13
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,199
I'm sorry

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,366
Be careful

15
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,603
She's looking after the foster
children, too, isn't she

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,004
That's right.

17
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,473
It must be rough Jiel ing
Po/aise children and

18
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,108
training to be a dancer

19
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,776
Drink up!

20
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,277
And eat up, too

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,252
I'm home!

22
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,256
It's really terrible.
Shota's crying.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,558
4A/hat rey lidoin 9

24
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,128
I thought it might be mixed
in with the laundry.

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,197
But I thought Shota had
put it away in a box

26
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,066
He did, but

27
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,540
You're right! It's gone.

28
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,443
We looked everywhere
in this room.

29
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,012
Between the bedding, and
under the bed, too.

30
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,714
Did he take it out
of here?

31
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,682
He said he didn't

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,285
After that time, he put it away
in the box and only looked

33
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,853
at it once in a while.

34
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,655
Then why is it gone?

35
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,959
Don't cry, Shota

36
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,061
Just wait. I'll find
it for you

37
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,631
What are you doing?

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,766
I'm looking for Shota's
towel blanket.

39
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,601
I don't think it's here

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,137
When I hung out the laundry,
I didn't see it

41
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,873
It might have fallen out
here by mistake

42
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,108
Like the last time

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,790
Yuria..

44
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,893
You know
where it is

45
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,298
Then why wouldn't you
look me in the eye just now?

46
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,133
No reason

47
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,406
It's over here,
isn't it?

48
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,708
It's not there

49
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,079
Then let me look

50
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,056
I found it!
What's this?

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,526
I don't know

52
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,868
Why did you hide it?

53
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,773
Because

54
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,675
you don't need
it anymore

55
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,511
You have your mother

56
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,148
Yuria

57
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,194
Look after him, Akira

58
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,070
Yuria...

59
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,741
Come downstairs and
talk to me

60
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,710
1

61
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,093
Yuria

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,930
Think really hard about
your feelings

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,569
Aren't you feeling lonely
because Shota might be

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,440
leaving this house?

65
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,580
If that's true, then what
you're doing is the

66
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,250
opposite of what
you're feeling.

67
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,953
What you're doing is
just tormenting him

68
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,858
You know you shouldn't
do that, don't you?

69
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,697
You should get along with
Shota while he's here.

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,269
Think about it really
carefully, and if you

71
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,906
feel bad about what you
did to Shota, then

72
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,541
apologize to him

73
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,279
That's all.

74
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,833
Her feelings are so mixed
up right now, she's

75
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,401
doing strange things

76
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,909
1

77
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,212
What?

78
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm sorry about
what I did.

79
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,521
I won't do it anymore 

80
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,652
It's Sunday, and Hitomi

I'll check the a dierice,

87
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,240
If that's the case, he
should have made this

88
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,274
a little bigger,
don't you think?

00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:49,895
Mom!

96
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,231
Hello

97
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,667
You came?

98
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,537
I was here on business
anyway.

99
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:03,808
That's Shota

100
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,380

Shota's mother

101
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,152
Which means the guy
next to her is...

102
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,720
Her fiance

103
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,656
He was playing with
Shota the other day.

104

105

He sells bento IGnr >S

You don't sound too
enthusiastic.

One more time!

My tnomis...

126
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,796
Why didn't you say
something sooner?

127
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,433
You knew about Shota
from the beginning.

128
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,769
I did, but...

129
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm really sorry

130
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,407
In \i
y case..

131
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,586
It's going to be a little hard
for us to get married now..

132
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,989
I'm sorry... Really sorry

133
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,859
What? They're not
getting married?

134
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,395
That's what he said.

135
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,432
Why?

136
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,835
His mother's against
the marriage

137
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,505
He never told his mother
about Shota

138
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,542
She must have said some
harsh things since

139
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,977
she's the owner of an old,
traditional restaurant

140
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,046
Wait a minute..

141
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,781
If they're not getting
married then what's

142
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,284
going to happen to Shota?

143
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,120
It doesn't have anything
to do with Shota, does it?

144
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,922
Even if his mother doesn't
get married she can

145
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,657
still take him back,
can't she?

146
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,259
I suppose, but..

147
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,363
Hitomi.. Encore

148
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,672
Go on, Hitomi!

149
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,374
Thanks.

150
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,291
After she went home,
Hitomi didn't mention

151
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,260
what had happened.

152
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,701
Shota, what are
you making?

153
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,202
A house

154
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,339
What house?

155
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,975
This house

156
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,643
This house?

157
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,912
The Ippongi house.

158
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,815
This is the sitting room, and
when you go upstairs,

159
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,617
this is my room

160
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,952
Right here

161
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,521
This room.

162
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,157
She was hoping that her
doubts would end

163
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,125

-Thank you

163
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,644
Keiko... The day of the
funeral was the first

164
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,115
time in 17 years thaftAomoko
came back to Tsukishima.

165
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,619
S thought she wouldn't
come back, but.

166
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,188
She had no qualms about
coming back home

167
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,824
She must really have
nerves of^steei

168
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,593
After what she put her
parents through..

169
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,529
Isn't that enough?
It's all irrthe past!

170
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,164
No, it's not*

171
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,666
haven't forgotten

172
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:00,605
ner e Niusband, Nagase got
4iimself in over his Jiead

173
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,676
in de , and do you know
What he asked me Jo do?

174
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:09,381
e ed me to sell the
house and store, so

175
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,752
he could pay off Jiis debt

176
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,322
What do you think
of that?

177
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,458
On top of that, she took
his side, and told me

178
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,260
Just sell the store, Dad
Why don't you just

179
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,397
sell the store? Give Nagase
a chance Once we pay off

180
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,832
"the debt, we'll make
a orofit"

181
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,435
gt's unbelie able'

182
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,638
^ou really re a
alicious p frson

183
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,542
If you'fcant to bring th \
up, t on I haven't

184
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,144

told me either...

185
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,148
CarryingHitomi,ivho

disowning y W

187
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,952
Do *t ever set foot in
thsh use again'"

188
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,788
That's why i couldn't come
home until the 'uneral.

189
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,489
Momo

190
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,691
dako

191
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,259
Are you fighting again?

192
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,161
You're scaring off
the customers.

193
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,495
They won't come
in here now

194
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,465
hy do you have to fight
when Keiko's here?

195
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,399
That's right

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,135
Keiko should hear this, s5
tie doesn't make the cime

197
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,637
mistake with a man!

198
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,207
Besides, Momoko, you're
a bad judge of men

199
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,076
Will you listen
to this, Keiko?

200
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:15,347
Her ex husband, Nagase
was so flashy

201
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,250
He started some kind of event
company in Roppongi

202
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,686
He told me because of the
bubble economy ^he was

203
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,421
going to be flood ~d
with business.

204
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,890
And fie was going to make
ifijch
so mucn money

205
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,126
I hatemen like that!

206
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,995
That's enough already.
I'm leaving.

207
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,464

212
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,309
I'd like to come and

213
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,277
but 1 won't come near

214
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,813

and came over

230
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,359
After a fight like that
^anybody would have

231
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,428
a hard time saying
^anything to you

with randpa again?

235
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,073
I had some time, so I thought
I'd stop , and at

236
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,442
«whSt happens...? Oontyou

living close by now?

238
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,814
I'm 3ure he's actually
ha|ppy about it.

239
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,982
1 don't know about that.

240
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,918
Of course he is.

241
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,920
Atter all, You're

242
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,523
Living in that house,
J /ealize that even

243
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,594

245
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,438

246
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,707
you £an't get along better.

247
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,549
Keiko came to talk to me
when Momoko suddenly

248
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,218
showed up here.

249
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,754
Keiko was so surprised
hat she went home

250
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,056
without saying anything

251
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,893
That's because you and M fn
started fighting, isn't it?

252
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,864
Why can't the two of you be
more civil to each other?

253
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,533
I'm not fighting with her
because Twant to

254
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,935

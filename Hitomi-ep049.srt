CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 49

2
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,326
Looking for dance
performers...

3
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,662
It's on a Sunday afternoon
so it couldn't be anything

4
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,963
dangerous, could it?

5
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,798
It must be some kind
of event.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,503
I wasn't going to tell you about
going to the amusement park...

7
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,972
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,208
He's my only father.

9
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,411
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

10
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,382
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you...

11
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,052
And I want you to become
a kind person who can

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,089
understand those reasons.

13
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,367
May 2017

14
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,669
We're leaving!

15
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,338
Akira!

16
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,908
What happened, with Naoko?

17
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,210
You mean Shimada?

18
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,612
She lent me some
books again.

19
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,514
Did you make up?

20
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,382
I wrote a letter
to apologize.

21
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,118
I told her I was sorry
I yelled at her.

22
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,686
And what happened?

23
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,255
She apologized, too.

24
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,790
She said she was sorry
she ignored my feelings.

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,725
She did?

26
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,926
Isn't that great?

27
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,162
You'll get to be even
better friends now.

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,230
I'm leaving!

29
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,603
My phone...?

30
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,940
It's Mom...

31
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,243
Momoko? What does she want
so early in the morning?

32
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,779
Do you want to
answer?

33
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,914
Of course not!

34
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,782
I don't have anything
to say to Momoko.

35
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,919
Unlike Akira, you haven't made
any progress, have you?

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,554
Never mind! Just hurry,
and answer the phone.

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,422
I'm going to water the plants.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,260
Good morning, Mom.

39
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,963
Hitomi? I just got to work.

40
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,702
No... I'm at the Suzuran
Cosmetic branch office.

41
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,071
We just moved in today.

42
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,540
It's in a building in Ginza.
It's just one floor.

43
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm going to be working in Tokyo
as the assistant branch manager.

44
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,182
You're going to live here?

45
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,053
Watch out!

46
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,655
Stop that!

47
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,792
Hello? Hitomi?

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,561
Is that right? Momoko's
coming here?

49
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,163
Where is she going to live?

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,166
In Kamiya-cho... she's renting a
condo that the company pays for.

51
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,802
So you can see her
everyday now.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,005
You should let bygones be
bygones, and try to get.

53
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,641
along with Momoko, Katsu.

54
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,844
That's right. We can invite her
over for dinner once ni

55
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,446
a while, and we can
all eat together.

56
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,781
Don't be ridiculous!

57
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,950
I have high blood pressure.

58
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,488
Momoko living in Tokyo means
shortening my lifespan.

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,924
How stubborn!

60
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,069
Ms Ippongi...
Have some coffee.

61
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,071
Thank you.

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,806
Are you settled in yet?

63
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,209
More or less. How about
on your side?

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,010
Do you have enough help?

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,511
We're fine.

66
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,214
The lay-out may change a
little, but you can come,

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,482

this evening.

68

He won't tell me

97
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,819
What I think is that he

S thought she wouldn't
come back, but.

159
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,188
She had no qualms about
coming back home

160
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,824
She must really have
nerves of^steei

161
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,593
After what she put her
parents through..

162
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,529
Isn't that enough?
It's all irrthe past!

169
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,322
What do you think
of that?

170
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,458
On top of that, she took
his side, and told me

171
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,260
Just sell the store, Dad
Why don't you just

172
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,397

He started some kind of event
company in Roppongi

195

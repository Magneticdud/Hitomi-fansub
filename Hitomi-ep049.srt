CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 49

2
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,326
Looking for dance
performers...

3
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,662
It's on a Sunday afternoon
so it couldn't be anything

4
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,963
dangerous, could it?

5
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,798
It must be some kind
of event.

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,503
I wasn't going to tell you about
going to the amusement park...

7
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,972
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,208
He's my only father.

9
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,411
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

10
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,382
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you...

11
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,052
And I want you to become
a kind person who can

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,089
understand those reasons.

13
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,367
May 2017

14
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,669
We're leaving!

15
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,338
Akira!

16
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,908
What happened, with Naoko?

17
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,210
You mean Shimada?

18
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,612
She lent me some
books again.

19
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,514
Did you make up?

20
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,382
I wrote a letter
to apologize.

21
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,118
I told her I was sorry
I yelled at her.

22
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,686
And what happened?

23
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,255
She apologized, too.

24
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,790
She said she was sorry
she ignored my feelings.

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,725
She did?

26
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,926
Isn't that great?

27
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,162
You'll get to be even
better friends now.

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,230
I'm leaving!

29
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,603
My phone...?

30
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,940
It's Mom...

31
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,243
Momoko? What does she want
so early in the morning?

32
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,779
Do you want to
answer?

33
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,914
Of course not!

34
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,782
I don't have anything
to say to Momoko.

35
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,919
Unlike Akira, you haven't made
any progress, have you?

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,554
Never mind! Just hurry,
and answer the phone.

37
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,422
I'm going to water the plants.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,260
Good morning, Mom.

39
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,963
Hitomi? I just got to work.

40
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,702
No... I'm at the Suzuran
Cosmetic branch office.

41
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,071
We just moved in today.

42
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,540
It's in a building in Ginza.
It's just one floor.

43
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,079
I'm going to be working in Tokyo
as the assistant branch manager.

44
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,182
You're going to live here?

45
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,053
Watch out!

46
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,655
Stop that!

47
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,792
Hello? Hitomi?

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,561
Is that right? Momoko's
coming here?

49
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,163
Where is she going to live?

50
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,166
In Kamiya-cho... she's renting a
condo that the company pays for.

51
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,802
So you can see her
everyday now.

52
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,005
You should let bygones be
bygones, and try to get

53
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,641
along with Momoko, Katsu.

54
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,844
That's right. We can invite her
over for dinner once in

55
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,446
a while, and we can
all eat together.

56
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,781
Don't be ridiculous!

57
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,950
I have high blood pressure.

58
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,488
Momoko living in Tokyo means
shortening my lifespan.

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,924
How stubborn!

60
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,069
Ms. Ippongi...
Have some coffee.

61
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,071
Thank you.

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,806
Are you settled in yet?

63
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,209
More or less. How about on your side?

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,010
Do you have enough help?

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,511
We're fine.

66
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,214
The lay-out may change a
little, but you can come,

67
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,482
and take look this evening.

68
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,285
Ms. Ippongi!

69
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,320
Your business cards are ready.

70
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,626
Assistant branch manager...?

71
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,695
Sounds important, doesn't it?

72
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,797
It means you have a heavy responsibility,

73
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,166
You're going to make Suzuran
Cosmetics that was only

74
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,969
known in Hokkaido, a brand
name throughout Japan.

75
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,004
We're going to sell it to all
the department stores

76
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,939
in Tokyo, so be prepared.

77
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,479
So Momoko's the assistant
branch manager...?

78
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,316
She must have worked
really hard in Sapporo.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,817
So it seems.

80
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,353
She started in sales, and she
must have sold lots and

81
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,821
lots of cosmetics.

82
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,157
It would be nice if she and
Katsu could make up.

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,693
That's what Ume said, too.

84
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,063
But Grandpa doesn't seem
to have any intention

85
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,464
of even trying.

86
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,933
By the way, Yu...

87
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,935
Did you and Mari make up yet?

88
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,505
Let's not talk about that anymore.

89
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,441
Sounds suspicious to me.

90
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,975
He hasn't been to "Matsuri" lately.

91
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,279
What happened between the
two of you anyway?

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,881
You were getting
along so well.

93
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,783
He won't tell me
even if I ask.

94
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,819
What I think is that he
probably got drunk,

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,620
and held her hand.

96
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,891
He took hold of her hand
like this, and said,

97
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,493
"I love you. Mari."

98
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,862
And she told him, "Stop that,"
and slapped his hand.

99
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,464
You idiot!

100
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,099
Don't talk about that anymore!

101
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,367
Why?

102
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,534
You don't have to
yell at me.

103
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,469
I'm eating!

104
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,703
Eat your lunch already!

105
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,071
You don't have to tell me. I'll eat.

106
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,408
He did it, didn't he?

107
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,410
He definitely did it.

108
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,178
No mistake about it.

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,553
Dad...?

110
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,323
Keiko! Are you off today?

111
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,658
No... I just got off
from the night shift.

112
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,060
I see...

113
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,429
I have something to tell you.

114
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,131
What is it?

115
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,465
Just something...

116
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,634
I'll tell you after I offer
incense to Mom.

117
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,386
So, Keiko... What is it
you want to talk about?

118
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,224
It's...

119
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,661
I'm, sorry! Can we talk
out in the store?

120
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,763
It might be easier to talk there.

121
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,298
You're right...

122
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,337
Sit over here, Keiko.

123
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,042
So what is it you want
to talk about?

124
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,245
It's...

125
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,648
Wait a minute! I think
i just saw something

126
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,716
really disgusting
walk by here.

127
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,787
I knew it!

128
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,790
Hello!

129
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,259
Hello, Keiko.

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,427
Hello.

131
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,162
What did you come here for?

132
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,397
I don't have any
business with you.

133
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,631
I didn't come to see you.

134
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,066
I come to tell Mom...

135
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,101
...that I've been transferred
to Tokyo, and I'll be

136
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,770
living in Tokyo now.

137
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,171
I heard from Hitomi...

138
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,207
Your office is in Ginza, isn't it?

139
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,642
It's really close
to Tsukishima.

140
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,945

-Thank you

150
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,644
Keiko... The day of the
funeral was the first

151
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,115
time in 17 years thaftAomoko
came back to Tsukishima.

152
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,619
S thought she wouldn't
come back, but.

153
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,188
She had no qualms about
coming back home

154
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,824
She must really have
nerves of^steei

155
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,593
After what she put her
parents through..

156
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,529
Isn't that enough?
It's all irrthe past!

157
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,164
No, it's not*

158
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,666

162
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,752
he could pay off Jiis debt

163
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,322
What do you think
of that?

164
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,458
On top of that, she took
his side, and told me

165
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,260
Just sell the store, Dad
Why don't you just

166
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,397
sell the store? Give Nagase
a chance Once we pay off

167
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,832

Are you fighting again?

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,161
You're scaring off

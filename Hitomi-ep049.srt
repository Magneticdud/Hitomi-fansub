CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 49

3
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,141
Looking for dance
performers...

4
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,778
It's on a Sunday afternoon so it
couldn't be anything dangerous, could it?

5
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:39,613
It must be some kind
of event.

6
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:44,317
I wasn't going to tell you about
going to the amusement park...

7
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:46,820
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,022
He's my only father.

9
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,258
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

10
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:57,196
Your father had his reasons
for leaving you...

11
00:01:57,196 --> 00:02:03,903
And I want you to become a kind
person who can understand those reasons.

12
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:15,180
May 2017

13
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,483
We're leaving!

14
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,151
Akira!

15
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:22,721
What happened, with Naoko?

16
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,057
You mean Shimada?

17
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,458
She lent me some
books again.

18
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:28,326
Did you make up?

19
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,228
I wrote a letter
to apologize.

20
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:32,931
I told her I was sorry
I yelled at her.

21
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,499
And what happened?

22
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:36,067
She apologized, too.

23
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,636
She said she was sorry
she ignored my feelings.

24
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:39,537
She did?

25
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:40,738
Isn't that great?

26
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,007
You'll get to be even
better friends now.

27
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:45,076
I'm leaving!

28
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,449
My phone...?

29
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:54,785
It's Mom...

30
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,088
Momoko? What does she want
so early in the morning?

31
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,591
Do you want to
answer?

32
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:01,759
Of course not!

33
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,627
I don't have anything
to say to Momoko.

34
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:06,730
Unlike Akira, you haven't made
any progress, have you?

35
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:08,398
Never mind! Just hurry,
and answer the phone.

36
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,267
I'm going to water the plants.

37
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,105
Good morning, Mom.

38
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:17,808
Hitomi? I just got to work.

39
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,546
No... I'm at the Suzuran
Cosmetic branch office.

40
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:25,915
We just moved in today.

41
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,384
It's in a building in Ginza.
It's just one floor.

42
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,890
I'm going to be working in Tokyo
as the assistant branch manager.

43
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,026
You're going to live here?

44
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,896
Watch out!

45
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,499
Stop that!

46
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,635
Hello? Hitomi?

47
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,405
Is that right? Momoko's
coming here?

48
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,006
Where is she going to live?

49
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:54,009
In Kamiya-cho... she's renting a
condo that the company pays for.

50
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,645
So you can see her
everyday now.

51
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,848
You should let bygones be
bygones, and try to get

52
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:02,484
along with Momoko, Katsu.

53
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,687
That's right. We can invite her
over for dinner once in

54
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,289
a while, and we can
all eat together.

55
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,624
Don't be ridiculous!

56
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,793
I have high blood pressure.

57
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:16,297
Momoko living in Tokyo means
shortening my lifespan.

58
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,766
How stubborn!

59
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,878
Ms. Ippongi...
Have some coffee.

60
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:32,913
Thank you.

61
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,648
Are you settled in yet?

62
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:37,017
More or less. How about on your side?

63
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:37,851
Do you have enough help?

64
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,353
We're fine.

65
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,056
The lay-out may change a
little, but you can come,

66
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,323
and take look this evening.

67
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,126
Ms. Ippongi!

68
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,161
Your business cards are ready.

69
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,468
Assistant branch manager...?

70
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,536
Sounds important, doesn't it?

71
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,638
It means you have a heavy responsibility,

72
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,007
You're going to make Suzuran
Cosmetics that was only

73
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,777
known in Hokkaido, a brand
name throughout Japan.

74
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,845
We're going to sell it to all
the department stores

75
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:07,747
in Tokyo, so be prepared.

76
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,287
So Momoko's the assistant
branch manager...?

77
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,156
She must have worked
really hard in Sapporo.

78
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,658
So it seems.

79
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,193
She started in sales, and she
must have sold lots and

80
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:22,661
lots of cosmetics.

81
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,997
It would be nice if she and
Katsu could make up.

82
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:27,533
That's what Ume said, too.

83
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,903
But Grandpa doesn't seem
to have any intention

84
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,304
of even trying.

85
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:34,773
By the way, Yu...

86
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:36,775
Did you and Mari make up yet?

87
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:40,345
Let's not talk about that anymore.

88
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,280
Sounds suspicious to me.

89
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,815
He hasn't been to "Matsuri" lately.

90
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:47,118
What happened between the
two of you anyway?

91
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,721
You were getting
along so well.

92
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,623
He won't tell me
even if I ask.

93
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:53,658
What I think is that he
probably got drunk,

94
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,460
and held her hand.

95
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,731
He took hold of her hand
like this, and said,

96
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,332
"I love you. Mari."

97
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:03,701
And she told him, "Stop that,"
and slapped his hand.

98
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:05,303
You idiot!

99
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,938
Don't talk about that anymore!

100
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,205
Why?

101
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:09,373
You don't have to
yell at me.

102
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,307
I'm eating!

103
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,542
Eat your lunch already!

104
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,910
You don't have to tell me. I'll eat.

105
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:16,246
He did it, didn't he?

106
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,248
He definitely did it.

107
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,017
No mistake about it.

108
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:28,392
Dad...?

109
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:31,161
Keiko! Are you off today?

110
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,496
No... I just got off
from the night shift.

111
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,898
I see...

112
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,267
I have something to tell you.

113
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,968
What is it?

114
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,303
Just something...

115
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:42,472
I'll tell you after I offer
incense to Mom.

116
00:06:58,554 --> 00:07:01,223
So, Keiko... What is it
you want to talk about?

117
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,061
It's...

118
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,498
I'm, sorry! Can we talk
out in the store?

119
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:11,600
It might be easier to talk there.

120
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,135
You're right...

121
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,174
Sit over here, Keiko.

122
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,878
So what is it you want
to talk about?

123
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:27,082
It's...

124
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,484
Wait a minute! I think
I just saw something

125
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,553
really disgusting
walk by here.

126
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,623
I knew it!

127
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,626
Hello!

128
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,095
Hello, Keiko.

129
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,263
Hello.

130
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:43,998
What did you come here for?

131
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,232
I don't have any
business with you.

132
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,467
I didn't come to see you.

133
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,902
I come to tell Mom...

134
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,937
...that I've been transferred
to Tokyo, and I'll be

135
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,605
living in Tokyo now.

136
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,007
I heard from Hitomi...

137
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,042
Your office is in Ginza, isn't it?

138
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,478
It's really close
to Tsukishima.

139
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,780
I'm so worried with you
hanging around here

140
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,982
that it'll threaten the
public safety of the

141
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,951
people around here.

142
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,586
Don't say strange things like that

143
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,054
in front of Keiko.

144
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,723
I'm going in.

145
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,759
Wait a minute. You didn't submit
a permit to come in here.

146
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,994
So where do I get that?

147
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,628
It's back at your place, of course!

148
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,007
Thank you.

149
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,478
Keiko... The day of the
funeral was the first

150
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,949
time in 17 years that Momoko
came back to Tsukishima.

151
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,452
I thought she wouldn't
come back, but...

152
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,022
She had no qualms about
coming back home.

153
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,657
She must really have
nerves of steel.

154
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:48,427
After what she put her
parents through...

155
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,363
Isn't that enough?
It's all in the past!

156
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:52,998
No, it's not!

157
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:54,499
I haven't forgotten.

158
00:08:55,067 --> 00:09:00,438
Her ex-husband, Nagase, got
himself in over his head

159
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:04,509
in debt, and do you know
what he asked me to do?

160
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:09,214
He asked me to sell the
house and store, so

161
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:13,584
he could pay off his debt.

162
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,155
What do you think of that?

163
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,291
On top of that, she took
his side, and told me...

164
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,093
"Just sell the store, Dad.
Why don't you just

165
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:25,229
sell the store? Give Nagase
a chance Once we pay off

166
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,665
the debt, we'll make a profit."

167
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,267
It's unbelievable!

168
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,470
You really are a
malicious person.

169
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,374
If you want to bring that
up, then I haven't

170
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:38,976
forgotten what you
told me either...

171
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:42,979
Carrying Hitomi, who
was still this little...

172
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,714
You told me, "I'm
disowning you!

173
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,783
Don't ever set foot in
this house again!"

174
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,619
That's why I couldn't come
home until the funeral.

175
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:51,321
Momo...

176
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:52,522
Mako!

177
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:54,090
Are you fighting again?

178
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,992
You're scaring off
the customers.

179
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,327
They won't come
in here now.

180
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:00,296
Why do you have to fight
when Keiko's here?

181
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,230
That's right.

182
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,966
Keiko should hear this, so
she doesn't make the same

183
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,468
mistake with a man!

184
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:09,038
Besides, Momoko, you're
a bad judge of men.

185
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,906
Will you listen to this, Keiko?

186
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:15,177
Her ex-husband, Nagase
was so flashy.

187
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:19,081
He started some kind of event
company in Roppongi.

188
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,517
He told me because of the
bubble economy, he was

189
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:23,252
going to be flooded
with business.

190
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,721
And he was going to make
so much money.

191
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,956
I hate men like that!

192
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:29,825
That's enough already.
I'm leaving.

193
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,294
I shouldn't have come.

194
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,996
I was transferred, and
I'll be working in

195
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,665
our branch office
in Ginza.

196
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,566
That's close by!

197
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,835
You should come
here for lunch.

198
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:44,139
I'd like to come and
eat your "monja",

199
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,107
but I won't come near
this house again.

200
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,643
I'm sorry about that.

201
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:49,677
Not at all.

202
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,579
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Keiko.

203
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,824
The nuisance is gone.
What a relief!

204
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,027
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Keiko.

205
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,929
What did you want to talk to me about?

206
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,397
Never mind.

207
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,300
I think I'd better go, too.

208
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,701
You don't have to go. What is it?

209
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,203
It doesn't have
to be today.

210
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,271
I'll come back again soon.

211
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:20,073
Goodbye.

212
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:27,547
What's with her anyway?

213
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:29,516
She came here because she
want to talk to me.

214
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:30,884
She just got off from
the night shift,

215
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:32,252
and came over.

216
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:34,187
After a fight like that,
anybody would have

217
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:36,256
a hard time saying
anything to you.

218
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,490
You think so?

219
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,691
Of course.

220
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,697
What? You had a fight
with Grandpa again?

221
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,900
I had some time, so I thought
I'd stop by, and look at

222
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,269
what happens...? Don't you
think he should have been

223
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,438
a little happy that I'll be
living close by now?

224
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,641
I'm sure he's actually
happy about it.

225
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,810
I don't know about that.

226
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,745
Of course he is.

227
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,747
After all, You're his daughter!

228
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,350
Living in that house,
I realize that even

229
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,421
though Akira, Yuria and
Shota aren't really

230
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:13,925
his children, they're
like a real family.

231
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,265
You're his real daughter,
so I don't know why

232
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:22,534
you can't get along better.

233
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:31,375
Keiko came to talk to me
when Momoko suddenly

234
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,044
showed up here...

235
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,579
Keiko was so surprised
that she went home

236
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,882
without saying anything.

237
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,719
That's because you and Mom
started fighting, isn't it?

238
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:45,689
Why can't the two of you be
more civil to each other?

239
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,358
I'm not fighting with her
because I want to.

240
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,761
It's just that when I see
Momoko's face, all the

241
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,898
anger from the past just
comes flooding back...

242
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,736
Excuse me! I'd like
to buy a shirt.

243
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:01,938
Isn't it strange?

244
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:03,740
When I'm sitting in the store,
I don't get a single customer,

245
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,778
but as soon I come in here,
they come in. What is it anyway?

246
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,914
I'm coming!

247
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:14,684
My phone!

248
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,755
Its Keiko.

249
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:21,591
Hello!

250
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,726
Hitomi?

251
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,029
Is Dad nearby?

252
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,569
No... He's in the
store right now.

253
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:37,139
Actually, I need to talk to
you about something.

254
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:40,542
I went to Tsukishima to
talk to Dad about it

255
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,545
today, but I couldn't bring
myself to tell him.

256
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,283
Actually, there's someone
I want you to meet.

257
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:53,622
Don't tell me..
It's your boyfriend?

258
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:59,861
I think you could say he's
a little more than just a boyfriend...

259
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:03,398
Do you mean...

260
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:05,199
...you're getting married?

261
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,735
I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

262
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:11,339
Can you come out tonight?

263
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,607
I can... I sure can.

264
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:17,812
I'll meet you at ROSE
at about eight.

265
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:20,915
I won't tell Dad...

266
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:22,916
I mean. I won't tell Grandpa.

267
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,419
I'll see you later.

268
00:14:29,156 --> 00:14:30,424
Was that Momoko?

269
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,794
No... A friend.

270
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,996
A friend?

271
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:39,633
What shall I make
for dinner tonight?

272
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:44,704
A friend? You mean Yuka?

273
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:48,975
Keiko is going to introduce
her to her fiancé.

274
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,311
What is he tike?

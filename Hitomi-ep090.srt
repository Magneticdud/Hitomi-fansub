CHAPTER 15
Tearstained Towel Blanket
Episode 90

2
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,273
You're Mr Imazata,
aren't you?

3
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,842
What is this about?

4
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,877
I'm a member of
Shota's family.

5
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,714
My grandfather and I are raising
Shota in Tsukishima.

6
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,318
Mr. Imazata...

7
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,055
Why did you call off
your marriage?

8
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,726
e... Shota's mother
she's lost confidence, and

9
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,595
she can't raise Shota

10
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,500
She won't meet
Shota anymore.

11
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,368
Shota's really sad

12
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,704
It's none of your
business.

13
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,005
Yes, it is

14
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,474
I'm Shota's family.

15
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,943
Wait a minute. What are
you all doing here?

16
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,878
You're scaring my
customers away

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm sorry

18
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,215
I'm sorry, but there's
a reason for this..

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,522
Come back here!

20
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,457
Hey, Imazata.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,932
There he goes

22
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,071
I'm sorry

23
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,087
Shosuke

24
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,022
This is the guy
He's the one!

25
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,625
So you're the one..

26
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,529
Abandoning the woman you
love, and Shota?

27
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,696
I'll teach you

28
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,465
Wait a minute!

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,401
Don't run away

30
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,069
What's with all of
you anyway?

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,106
Mr Imazata... I'm not here
to complain to you

32
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,708
I have a favor
to ask you.

33
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,779
Shota was really happy when
you played with him on the

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,215
rooftop of the
department store.

35
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:07,386
And when I saw how happy he was,
it made me realize that this was

36
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,755
what would make Shota
truly happy.

37
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,925
After all, he would be
living with his real

38
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,428
mother, and their was
someone who would

39
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,463
become his father, too

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,570
That's what would make
Shota really happy

41
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,106
Please <<in- a ou
how Shota feels.

42
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,042
That's what I wanted, too

43
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,611
It seemed like Shota and
I would get along,

44
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,780
and I really intended for
the three of us to live

45
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,582
together, but

46
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,284
my mom

47
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,920
Your mom has nothing
to do with this!

48
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,255
Yes, she does!

49
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:47,593
She raised me all
by herself

50
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,394
I'm her only son

51
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,532
Eventually, I'm going to
take over the restaurant.

52
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,267
I'm all she has

53
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,401
1

54
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,071
Mr. Imazata... It's the
same with Shota and

55
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,973
Shota's mother, too

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,343
You're a full-grown man

57
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,445
should take responsibility
s man, ...

58
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,081
My responsibility as a son
is more important than

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,016
my responsibility
as a man.

60
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,287
I can't take on the burden
of Mikie's life, too

61
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,789
I n it* ath tic, but
this really made me

62
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,458
realize that

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:19,725
That does it!

64
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,592
That does it!

65
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,860
Calm down!

66
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,262
Just calm down

67
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,765
So what about Mikie?

68
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,272
I'm sorry, I'm just
not strong enough

69
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:41,446
This is Mikie ddf ^s and
cell phone number..

70
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,588
If you have something to
say, then say it to

71
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,156
her directly

72
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,760
It has nothing to do
with me anymore

73
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,163
1

74
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,534
1

75
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,202
1

76
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,473
He ran away

77
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,876
You coward!

78
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,911
What's wrong with him?

79
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,324
But what should I do?

80
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,927
\ think ylikie'jjS
ffluc.-: oo A/e<ik.

81
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,830
Ndt ^yihg t ^ confidence J
to raise Shota unless

82
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,964
has someone she
can re1y on

83
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,799
has someone she
can re1y on.

84
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,968
I can understand

85
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,475
Have you felt
that, too, Mom?

86
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,913
Right after the divorce,
when you were just

87
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,115
about Shota's age ..

88
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,619
I think I was relying on
your dad somewhere

89
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,888
deep in my heart.

90
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,727
I was at a loss right
after the divorce

91
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,929
I was busy at
work, too

92
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,097
When I came home in the
middle of the night,

93
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,398
When I came home in the
middle of the night

94
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,567
and saw you sleeping,
there were times

95
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,335
I would cry.

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,239
But you raised me,
didn't you?

97
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,844
That's because
you needed me

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,481
Every once in a while,
when I'd come home

99
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,548
Every once in a while,
when I'd come home

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,717
after work, you'd come
running to the door to

101
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,652
e come pne Jiome

102
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,855
h le m ate, you'd tell
about school and

103
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,290
what you saw on television

104
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,927
Every time that happened,
it made me realize that

105
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,063
I had to try harder.

106
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,368
You're the one who gave me
the courage to raise you.

107
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,602
Welcome home, Shota

108
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,376
What's wrong?

109
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,720
om on? ee e n more

110
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,464
She's busy right now,
so if you wait...

111
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,965
That's a lie!

112
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,901
Mom doesn't love me.

113
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,708
1

114
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,955
Hitomi! What's all
that racket?

115
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,959
Have you heard
of flying?

116
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,294
I'm going to do that now.

117
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,996
Wait! I don't
understand.

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,993
Mikie... Are you home?

119
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:50,962
This is Hitomi from
Tsukishima..

120
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,531
This is Hitomi from
Tsukishima

121
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,500
I live together with
Shota in Tsukishima

122
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,304
Mikie!

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,807
If you're home, please
open the door

124
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,877
Mikie!

125
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,180
Are you home?

126
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,889
Mikie

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,698
I know I did a terrible
thing to Shota, but

128
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,466
it can't helped.

129
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,672
I can't live without
someone to rely on.

130
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,677
What are you going
to do now?

131
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm going back to work

132
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,383
It's the only thing I
know how to do

133
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,723
He should forget
someone like me.

134
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,893
Shota would be much, much
happier if he stayed

135
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,128
in Tsukishima rather
than live with me

136
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,265
You're wrong! Shota
has always

137
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,068
Never mind!

138
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,171
I abandoned him once before.

139
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,175
Shota doesn't need
a mother like me.

140
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:17,082
All he needs is you and
his Tsukishima dad.

141
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,338
What is this?

142
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,575
It's Shota's treasure

143
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,282
Grandpa asked Shota what
he remembered about you

144
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,557
He said that he remembered
you lying in bed with him,

145
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,826
and telling him stories

146
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,367
"Bremen Town Musicians"

147
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,709
Shota remembers that
clearly even now

148
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:27,118
He sounded so happy When
he told us about that.

149
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:36,528
Isn't that the towel blanket you
covered him with back then?

150
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,801
He's treasured that ever
since he came to live

151
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,135
in Tsukishima.

152
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,469
in Tsukishima

153
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:55,180
I lost it once when I hung
out the bedding, and

154
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,249
he cried and looked for it

155
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,388
He was crying so hard that
I climbed on the roof

156
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,390
to look for it

157
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:18,169
To Shota, this was
his mother

158
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,108
Something he should
never lose

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,087
I love Shota, too.

160
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:43,728
So do my grandpa and
the other children

161
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:51,603
That's why we don't
want him to leave.

162
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,644
It would be unbearably
lonely when he's gone

163
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,046
But

164
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,787
it's you that he needs.

165
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:17,362
You can givr him what
my grandpa and I can't

166
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,970
Please live with Shota,
and raise him.

167
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,120
Shota

168
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,898
Shota

169
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,041
Shota

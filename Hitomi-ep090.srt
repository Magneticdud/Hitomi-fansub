I know I did a terrible
thing to Shota, but

128
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,466
it can't helped.

129
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,672
5 can't live without
someone to rely on.

130
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,677

t's the only thing
know howtotlo

133
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,723
He should forget
someone like me.

134
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,893
Shota wo 10t)e much, much
happier if he stayed

135
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,128
in Tsuki~hima rather
than live with me

136
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,265
You're wrong! jShota
has always

137
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,068

la andoned him once befoe.

139
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,175
Shota doesn't need
a mother like me.

140
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:17,082
II he needs is you an
his Tsukishima dad.

141
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,338
What is this?

142
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,575
Its Shota's treasure

143
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,282
Grandpa asked Shota^hat
he remembered about you

144
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,557
He said that he remembered
you lying in bed with hiffi,

145
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,826
and telling him stories

146
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,367
remen Town

147
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,709
a emembers that
e rly even now

148
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:27,118
He bounded so happy When
he told us about that.

149
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:36,528
Isn't that the to^el blan ^t you
covered him with back then?

150
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,801
He's treasured that ever
since he came to live

151
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,135
in Tsukishima.

152
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,469
in Tsukishima

153
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:55,180
lost It price when I hung
out the bedding, and

154
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,249
e c ied and looked for it

155
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,388
He was crying so hard that
I Climbed ont \he roof

156
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,390
to look for it

157
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:18,169
To Shota. this was
his mother

158
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,108
Something he should
never lose

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,087
I love Shota, too.

160
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:43,728
So do my grandpa and
the other children

161
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:51,603
t's why we don't
want him to leave.

162
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,644
it would be unbearably
lonely when he's gone

163
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,046
Bui

164
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,787
it's you that he needs.

165
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:17,362
You can givfc him what
my grandpa and I cant

166
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,970
Please live with Shota,
and raise him.

167
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,120
Shota

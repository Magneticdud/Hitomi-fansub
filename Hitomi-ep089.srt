00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,493
That's Shota

3
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,262
You're right! That must be
Shota's mother

4
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,399
Then the man next
to her is..

5
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,669
her fiance. He was playing

6
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,272
While I'm dan n , I'll
see that's ong or.

Wait a minute!

Child care counseling center

12
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:10,796
Mikie? H was going to
call you just now

13
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,533
Your next meeting
with Shota is

14
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,006
What do you mean?

15
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,343
Hello, Mikie?

16
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,212
Can you hear me, Mikie?

17
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,718
I've lost confidence

18
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,121
I can't raise him,
after all

19
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,893
So

20
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,562
I can't take Shota back

21
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,031
Did something happen?

22
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,601
In any case, let's
meet and

23
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,037
Hello?

24
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,306
Mikie? Hello?

25
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,712
I'm not getting married
after all

26
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,451
If you don't mind
can you explain...?

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,657
His mother was more
important to him

28
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,425
than me or Shota.

29
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,629
Even if this is the case,
I don't think it has

30
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,898
anything to do with
taking Shota back

31
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,768
You've finally started to
restore e bond with

32
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,170
him after meeting together
so many times, so I don't

33
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,772
think you should give
up so easily

34
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,273
I can't do it

35
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,109
Unless I have someone
by my side

36
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,646
Unless I fee! secure
I can't raise Shota

37
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,016
The same thing will
happen again

38
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,819
I don't want to make the
same mistake again

39
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,755
What are you going to
do about Shota?

40
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,591
He's going to be sad

41
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,159
He's finally gotten
close to you again

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,627
I'm sorry!

43
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,332
Please leave Shota with
his Tsukishima family.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,468
I'm sorry!

45
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,037
Mikie! Open the door

46
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,572
Ms Saito!

47
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,107
Open the door!

48
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,909
Ms Saito!

49
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,984
We waited an hour but
she wouldn't open the door

50
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,253
She won't answer
the phone either

51
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,090
If we stop the meetings
with his mother now

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,459
and forget about her
taking him back,

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,029
it will really hurt
Shota psychologicaily

54
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,466
Even if it's not made
clear, children are

55
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,301
very sensitive

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,604
He's been preparing himself
to leave Tsukishima and

57
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,907
going to live with
his mother again

58

We need to tell Katsutaro
about this, don't we?

66
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,412
I'll leave it to you.

72
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,979
Don't you think that's
irresponsible?

73
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,681
We're sorry

74
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,883
I didn't mean all of you

75
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,153
I meant Shota's mother

76
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,358
How can she say that she
can't take him back now?

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,927
What does she mean she
doesn't have confidence?

78
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,662
It's a problem for us too,
for her to say that she

79
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,731
can't take him back now

80
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,033
We'll take whatever
steps necessary

81
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,836
We'll continue to keep
in contact with Mikie

82
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,341
Under the circumstances,
what's most important

83
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,677
is Shota's feelings.

84
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,846
That's right

85
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,250
After he's finally gotten close
to his mother again.

86
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,555
Inoue will explain to Shota
about postponing

87
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,924
their next meeting.

88
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,896
Please gives Shota all the
support he needs

89
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,066
We will

90
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,136
Thank you

91
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,182
About your meeting with
your mother.. She's

92
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,686
too busy to meet with you
this week, so she wants

93
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,189
to postpone it for a while

94
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,528
It's OK

95
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,164
When can we meet again?

96
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,333
We don't know yet

97
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,068
She's busy at work so
she can't find the

98
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,304
time to meet right now

99
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,910
So Mom doesn't love
me, after all

100
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,146
1

101
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,482
That's not true.

102
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,050
She's just busy
at work

103
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,120
That's right.. She's
your mother, Shota

104
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,024
How could she not love you?
She loves you very much!

105
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,662
Then why won't
she meet with me?

106
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,767
1

107
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,621
1

108
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,087
Katsutaro started to tell
him that it's not that

109
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,589
she doesn't love him, but 

110
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,758
I9CC Tk

111
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:52,397
I can't blame Shota for
feeling that way

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,636
I called Mikie, but as usual I just
got her answering machine.

113
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,205
She hasn't gone to work
either, has she?

114
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,207
So it seems.

115
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,042
She can't recover from
the shock of having

116
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,111
her engagement
fall apart, but

117
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:10,515
What we need to worry
about is Shota

118
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,685
You're right

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,188
What's most important is
Shota's future.

120
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:21,126
Yes, take heart,
and keep working at it.

121
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,364
The next day Hitomi went to
the child care counseling

122
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,865
center by herself.

123
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,805
Shota's deeply hurt..

124
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,941
He's saying that his mother
doesn't love him after all.

125
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,378
Shota's in pain

126
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,615
I'll give her a
piece of my mind.

127
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,149
Tell me where she lives

128
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,318
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

129
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,921
^JOlDL tfl^T^l
that ^car.

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,959
Mikies ill and
emotionally unstable right now

131
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,061
Until she recovers

132
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,330
U J â€¢ 'dL ^i'J'ik, iJl'J 1-^jJjH} i' 1
de Ire tb rais o a again

133
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,735
But if we do that, it'll hurt
Shota even more.

134
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,237
He's been hiding it all
this time, but he's

135
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,073
wanted to go to his
mother all along.

136
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,477
You've opened the lid
on those feelings...

137
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,979
Isn't there anything
you can do?

138
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:54,319
Hitomi... We Yittp do what
we can to support Shota

139
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,623
But in order to raise a child,
St important

140
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,558
the parent's feelings.

141
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,329
If they have what it takes,
then we'll do our best

142
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,331
to support them

143
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,535
But they hav to
have the desire.

144
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,988
She couldn't ar e it 1
what Mr. Wakayama

145
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,528
Hitomi didn't know
where to turn.

146
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,273
The next day...

147
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,449
I never heard of anything
so terrible

148
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,417
I feel so sorry
for Shota.

149
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,387
I agree... How could she
say she wants him and

150
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,889
then turn around and say
she changed her mind?

151
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,292
What kind of mother
is she anyway?

152
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,294
I can understand that
i 3

153
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,563
your on emen all
t like that, but

154
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,998
she can at least raise
her own child

155
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,168
No, she's just weak...

156
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,371
A woman who can't live
without a man...

157
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,873
I understand how
she feels.

158
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,109
But the woman is hopeless

159

165

That man is the root
of all evil.

166
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,827
Who is he anyway?

167
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,597
His name is Imazata, and
he's heaorily s to of

168
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,465
a Japanese restaurant
in Akasaka.

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,801
Imazato in Akasaka?

170
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,703
You've heard of it?

171
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,538
It's a well-known and
established restaurant

172
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,607
His picture came out in

He sells bento undies at
the department store,

175
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:58,943
doesn't he?

176
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,978
That's right, that's him.

177
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,112
I've seen him
around here

178
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,213
Me, too

179
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,882
Probably to shop for
the restaurant.

180
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,916
Really.

181
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,019
He comes every Friday to
buy dried food at Shige's

182
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,557
I've never talked to him, but
Shige told me about him.

183
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,225
What time does he come?

184
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,995
The last time I saw him,
it was about 10 o'clock.

185
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,031
Friday at 10?

186
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,840
That's right now!

187
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,413
Hitomi!

188
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,315
Wait, Hitomi!

189
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,517
Come back!

190
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,689
I'd better go along, too

191
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,560
Bring him over here!

192
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,928
Okay

193
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,732
I'll punch his
lights out!

194
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,135
You don't have to go
that far..

195

196
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,505
^fs go back inside.

197
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,340
Go inside and
have some tea.

198
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,651
Hitomi.. That shim

199
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,085
O O â€¢ Â« 1 â€¢ â€¢ *

200
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,720
The guy in the suit!

201
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,295
You're Imazata,
aren't you?

202
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,298
Yes, I am ...

203
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,735
What is this about?

204
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,439
I'm a member of
Shota's family

205
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,276
My grandfather and I are raising
Shota in Tsukishima.

206
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,616
Hitomi had something
that she wanted to tell

207
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,152
this man who ended his
engagement to Mikie.

208
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,088
and hurt Shota badly

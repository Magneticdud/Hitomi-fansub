Canvyou4iearme, Mikie?

17
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,718
I've lost confidence

18
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,121
I can't r 1se him,
after all

19
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,893
So

20
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,562
can't take Shota back

21
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,031
-Old something happen?

22
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,601

00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,306
Mikie? Hello?

25
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,712
I'm not getting married.
after all

26
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,451
If you don't mind
can you explain...?

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,657
His mother was more
important to him

28
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,425
than me or Shota.

29
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,629
Even if th V,s the case,
I don't think itjias

30
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,898
anything to do with
taking Shota back

31
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,768
You've finally started to
restore e bond with

32
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,170
him after meeting together
so many imes, so I don't

33
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,772
think you hould give
up so easily

34
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,273
1 can't do it

35
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,109
Unless iTiave someone
by my side

36
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,646
UPless I fee! secure
I can't raise Shota

37
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,016
The same thing will
happen again

38
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,819
1 don't want to make the
same mistake again

39
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,755
What are ou doing to
doabo t Shota?

40
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,591
He's going to be sad

41
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,159
He's finally gotten
close to ou again

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,627
I'm sorry!

43
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,332
Please leave Shota with
his Tsukishima family.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,468
I'm sorry!

45
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,037

49
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,984
We waited hour but
she wouldn he dobr

She won't Y

51
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,090
I we stop the meetings
ith his mother now

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,459
and forget about having
er take him back,

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,029
t's really going to hurt
Shota psychoiogicaily

54
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,466
Even if it's" ot made
clear, children are

55
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,301
very sensitive

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,604
He's been reparing himself
to leave Tsukishima and

57
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,907

How can she say that she
can 1 lake him back now?

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,927
What does she mean she
-doesn't have confidence?

78
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,662
It's a problem for us. too,
for hfefto say that she

79
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,731
can't {a fe him back now

80
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,033
We'll take whatever
steps necessary

81
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,836
We'll continue to keep
in contact with Mikie

82
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,341
Under the circumstances,
w lat's most important

83
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,677
is Shota's feelings.

84
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,846
That's right

85
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,250
After he's finally gotten close
to his mother again.

86
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,555

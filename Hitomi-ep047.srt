CHAPTER 8
"Two kinds of Love"
Episode 47

2
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,382
Don't tell Sano...

3
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,953
Goodbye!

4
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,389
Naoko!

5
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,198
Good night.

6
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,134
Good night...

7
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,812
I'm glad your part-time
job went weII.

8
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,248
It went better than
I expected...

9
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,784
At the beginning, I didn't
know what would happen.

10
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,420
What did Akira do today?

11
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,255
Akira?

12
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,290
He said he was going
to the library...

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,959
So I guess that's
where he went.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,461
When I asked him if Naoko
was coming over today,

15
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,097
he said they didn't make
any plans, so he didn't

16
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,966
think she was coming.

17
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,635
But I have a feeling that
deep down, he was hoping

18
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,737
that she'd come over.

19
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,408
I have something to
tell you, but...

20
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,215
What is it?

21
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,650
Just come with me.

22
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,959
Today's part-time job was at
the Arakawa Amusement Park...

23
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,062
Arakawa Amusement Park...

24
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,432
I ran into Naoko there.

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,904
She was there by herself.

26
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,374
She was at the amusement
park all by herself?

27
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,242
No, she wasn't playing.

28
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,345
She was just sitting on a bench
in front of the Ferris wheel.

29
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,282
When I went up to her, she
tried to run away.

30
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,121
Then she told me not to tell
Akira, and she ran off.

31
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,026
I wonder what that was all about.

32
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,163
Hitomi...

33
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,765
Come with me.

34
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,237
Akira was...

35
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,573
...abandoned by
his parent.

36
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,909
Abandoned?

37
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,013
His mother died soon
after giving birth

38
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,816
to Akira, so...

39
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,923
Akira was raised by his father.

40
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,430
What did his father
do for a living?

41
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,502
He ran a small
printing company.

42
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,341
But business started
going downhill until

43
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,244
finally, there was nothing he could do.

44
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:11,350
Akira said that one day
his father took him to

45
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,288
the amusement park in Arakawa
when he was five years old.

46
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:24,896
After Akira had ridden all
the rides in the park,

47
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:30,736
his father said he was going
to the bathroom, and he sat

48
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:36,008
him down at the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel.

49
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,978
He told him not to
move from there,

50
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,149
so he waited and waited for
his father to come back.

51
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,023
Because he was told not to
leave the bench, he kept

52
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,793
the promise, and just sat
there, waiting for him.

53
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,732
When the park closed, an
employee came, and asked

54
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,304
him his name, then a
policeman came...

55
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,109
What about his father?

56
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,613
He didn't come back.

57
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,151
He's still missing until this day.

58
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,456
He doesn't know if he's
dead or alive...

59
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:41,773
Akira told that story
to Naoko, didn't he?

60
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:54,820
But, in her own way, Naoko
was trying to understand

61
00:05:54,821 --> 00:06:00,425
how Akira felt back then,
by sitting on the same

62
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,462
bench that he sat on.

63
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,684
Hitomi felt like she had
touched on a part of

64
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,755
Akira's feelings that were
shut deep down in his heart.

65
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,910
Good morning, Shimada...

66
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,913
Sano... good morning.

67
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,990
I didn't expect Dazai Osamu
to be so interesting.

68
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,096
I went to the library to
study yesterday, but

69
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,733
I ended up reading his book
all the time I was there.

70
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,968
You did?

71
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,508
What did you do
yesterday?

72
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,480
Nothing much... I just
lay around all day.

73
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,350
You did?

74
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,932
He seems dispirited,
doesn't he?

75
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,600
His fever went down, didn't it?

76
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,402
But he says he doesn't have
much of an appetite.

77
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,537
Did something happen with Mari?

78
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,140
I'm sure of it. it was after
he came back from

79
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,209
"Matsuri" that he drank all night.

80
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,678
That's right.

81
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,079
Hello!

82
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,681
Mari?

83
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,418
Dai! Here's some pickled
vegetables... I bought

84
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,921
too much, so I thought I'd
share some with you.

85
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,890
Thank you for always
thinking of us.

86
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,995
Yuzo! Come to my place
to drink once in a while...

87
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,497
You haven't come
by at all lately.

88
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,999
I was holding back
since my dad was there.

89
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,101
You don't have to
worry about that.

90
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,370
Come with Katsu
sometime, Hitomi.

91
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:26,872
I will.

92
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,507
Goodbye.

93
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,584
Thank you!

94
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,587
That was cold!

95
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,560
That must have been
a masterpiece.

96
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,196
"Eyebrow cats"? I sure would
have liked to see that.

97
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,565
How about "Makoto Neko"?
(Makoto is his name; pun on similar pronunciation)

98
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,566
What do you mean?

99
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,268
A cat with my face?

100
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,936
Dancing like this...?

101
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,170
That might be good.

102
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,539
I'd like to see that.

103
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,507
A Tsukishima souvenir...
"Makoto Neko" for 500 yen.

104
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,642
It won't sell.

105
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,910
It'll never sell.

106
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,745
What are you saying?

107
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,517
I didn't expect you to hang in
there until the end, Yuka.

108
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,386
I wanted he money.

109
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,355
What did you decide you're
going to do from now?

110
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,723
Are you going back home?

111
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,824
No, I'm not.

112
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,394
I'm going to rent an apartment,
somewhere and live by myself.

113
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,829
Are you really going to do that?

114
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,398
I've already decided.

115
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,700
After all, even I think it's
strange for me to live in

116
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,536
luxury with my parents' money
while I'm always complaining

117
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,905
about them all the time.

118
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,307
It made me feel sick.

119
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,474
But it's not easy...

120
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,576
You'll have to work part-time.

121
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,577
I'll find something.

122
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,211
You'll have to separate
the trash yourself.

123
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,013
I can do that much.

124
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,282
In that case, you can
eat my share, too.

125
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,251
Are you sure?

126
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,752
Go ahead, and eat.

127
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,255
I like people who willingly
take on hardship.

128
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,057
Although I don't like your dancing.

129
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,925
I don't like your dancing either.

130
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,928
Let's just enjoy our
"monja" today.

131
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,338
Friendship suits "monja", doesn't it?

132
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,943
I bought croquettes.

133
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,012
It's Akira's favorite.

134
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,915
Then maybe I should put green
onions and deep-fried tofu

135
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,817
in the miso soup tonight...
Akira likes that.

136
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,721
No matter what happens, if
you eat food that you like

137
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,656
for dinner, you'll manage
to get through somehow.

138
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,625
Hello...

139
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,460
Yes?

140
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,527
It's Naoko.

141
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,432
Welcome.

142
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,535
Thank you for yesterday.

143
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,672
I didn't tell Akira.

144
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,041
Thank you.

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,776
Shimada...?

146
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,611
Sano...

147
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,682
Why are you here today?
Is it for math again?

148
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,919
No... I wanted to
talk to you.

149
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,654
You do?

150
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,658
Come on in then.

151
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,872
You don't have to serve
tea or anything

152
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,507
Really?

153
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,642
Okay...

154
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,283
I'm a little worried, so
should I take a look?

155
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,951
Do that.

156
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,071
What did you want to
talk to me about?

157
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,512
Actually, yesterday...

158
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,583
I went to the amusement park.

159
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,823
I sat down on the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel.

160
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,728
Why did you do that?

161
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,936
I wanted to know
how you felt...

162
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,273
...when you waited all that
time for your father.

163
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,644
I felt like crying.

164
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,319
I could see a small
roller coaster,

165
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,888
and the Merry-go-round.

166
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,894
When I thought that's what
you were looking at while

167
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,898
you waited for your father...

168
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,737
So what about it?

169
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,707
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,716
I wasn't going to tell
you about going to the

171
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,417
amusement park...

172
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:13,391
But I really didn't want to
hide anything from you.

173
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:22,934
That's why I'll never bring
up your father again, but

174
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,303
I wanted to tell you
what I did.

175
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm really sorry.

176
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
What is it anyway?

177
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,884
Sano...?

178
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,288
Why did you do that?

179
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,558
Why do you have to
talk about that?

180
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,159
Sano...?

181
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,862
Go home!

182
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,597
Just go home!

183
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,500
What do you think you're
doing, Akira?

184
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,935
It's none of your
business, Hitomi!

185
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,169
That has nothing to
do with it, does it?

186
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,504
Just leave me alone!

187
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,839
Akira!

188
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Wait, Akira!

189
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,542
What's wrong, Akira?

190
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,244
What happened?

191
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,779
Sano...?

192
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,418
I'll have you know...

193
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,753
That this is my
only father.

194
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,859
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

195
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,896
A father like that
isn't a father.

196
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,299
Wait, Akira!

197
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,767
Akira!

198
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,269
Come back, Akira!

199
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,171
Akira! Akira!

200
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,643
What happened?

201
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,144
Sorry about the
commotion...

202
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,881
Akira s hurting...

203
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,886
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt...

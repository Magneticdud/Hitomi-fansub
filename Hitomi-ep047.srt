00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:14,097
CHAPTER 8
"Two kinds of Love"
Episode 47

3
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,499
Don't tell Sano...

4
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,434
Goodbye!

5
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:29,336
Naoko!

6
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,678
Good night.

7
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:40,847
Good night...

8
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm glad your part-time
job went well.

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,720
It went better than
I expected...

10
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:58,264
At the beginning, I didn't
know what would happen.

11
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,220
What did Akira do today?

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,120
Akira?

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,800
He said he was going
to the library...

14
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,439
So I guess that's
where he went.

15
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,974
When I asked him if Naoko
was coming over today,

16
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,577
he said they didn't make
any plans, so he didn't

17
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:13,445
think she was coming.

18
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:18,217
But I have a feeling that deep down,
he was hoping that she'd come over.

19
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,888
I have something to
tell you, but...

20
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:29,694
What is it?

21
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:31,162
Just come with me.

22
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:40,438
Today's part-time job was at
the Arakawa Amusement Park...

23
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,574
Arakawa Amusement Park...

24
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:46,944
I ran into Naoko there.

25
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,415
She was there by herself.

26
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,885
She was at the amusement
park all by herself?

27
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,754
No, she wasn't playing.

28
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,823
She was just sitting on a bench
in front of the Ferris wheel.

29
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:02,793
When I went up to her, she
tried to run away.

30
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:08,632
Then she told me not to tell
Akira, and she ran off.

31
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,503
I wonder what that was all about.

32
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:17,674
Hitomi...

33
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,276
Come with me.

34
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,714
Akira was...

35
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:27,083
...abandoned by
his parent.

36
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,386
Abandoned?

37
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:37,293
His mother died soon after
giving birth to Akira, so...

38
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:45,433
Akira was raised by his father.

39
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:50,940
What did his father
do for a living?

40
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:57,012
He ran a small
printing company.

41
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,850
But business started
going downhill until

42
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,753
finally, there was nothing he could do.

43
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:10,859
Akira said that one day
his father took him to

44
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,763
the amusement park in Arakawa
when he was five years old.

45
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:24,405
After Akira had ridden all
the rides in the park,

46
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:30,244
his father said he was going
to the bathroom, and he sat

47
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:35,516
him down at the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel.

48
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:39,453
He told him not to
move from there,

49
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:43,624
so he waited and waited for
his father to come back.

50
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,530
Because he was told not to
leave the bench, he kept

51
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,301
the promise, and just sat
there, waiting for him.

52
00:04:55,268 --> 00:05:00,240
When the park closed, an
employee came, and asked

53
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,811
him his name, then a
policeman came...

54
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,583
What about his father?

55
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,120
He didn't come back.

56
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:18,658
He's still missing until this day.

57
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:23,963
He doesn't know if he's
dead or alive...

58
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:41,279
Akira told that story
to Naoko, didn't he?

59
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:54,325
But, in her own way, Naoko
was trying to understand

60
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:59,931
how Akira felt back then,
by sitting on the same

61
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,967
bench that he sat on.

62
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,188
Hitomi felt like she had
touched on a part of

63
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:29,259
Akira's feelings that were
shut deep down in his heart.

64
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,414
Good morning, Shimada...

65
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,417
Sano... good morning.

66
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:04,493
I didn't expect Dazai Osamu
to be so interesting.

67
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:10,599
I went to the library to
study yesterday, but

68
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,236
I ended up reading his book
all the time I was there.

69
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,471
You did?

70
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:23,011
What did you do
yesterday?

71
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:27,982
Nothing much... I just
lay around all day.

72
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,853
You did?

73
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,434
He seems dispirited,
doesn't he?

74
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,102
His fever went down, didn't it?

75
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,904
But he says he doesn't have
much of an appetite.

76
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,039
Did something happen with Mari?

77
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,642
I'm sure of it. it was after
he came back from

78
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,710
"Matsuri" that he drank all night.

79
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,179
That's right.

80
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,581
Hello!

81
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,182
Mari?

82
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,919
Dai! Here's some pickled
vegetables... I bought

83
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,422
too much, so I thought I'd
share some with you.

84
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,391
Thank you for always
thinking of us.

85
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,496
Yuzo! Come to my place
to drink once in a while...

86
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
You haven't come
by at all lately.

87
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,500
I was holding back
since my dad was there.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,602
You don't have to
worry about that.

89
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,871
Come with Katsu
sometime, Hitomi.

90
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:26,372
I will.

91
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,007
Goodbye.

92
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,084
Thank you!

93
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,087
That was cold!

94
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,060
That must have been
a masterpiece.

95
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,696
"Eyebrow cats"? I sure would
have liked to see that.

96
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,065
How about "Makoto Neko"?
(Makoto is his name; pun on
similar pronunciation)

97
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,066
What do you mean?

98
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,767
A cat with my face?

99
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,435
Dancing like this...?

100
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,670
That might be good.

101
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,038
I'd like to see that.

102
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,007
A Tsukishima souvenir...
"Makoto Neko" for 500 yen.

103
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,141
It won't sell.

104
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,409
It'll never sell.

105
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,244
What are you saying?

106
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:12,016
I didn't expect you to hang in
there until the end, Yuka.

107
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,885
I wanted he money.

108
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,854
What did you decide you're
going to do from now?

109
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,222
Are you going back home?

110
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:19,323
No, I'm not.

111
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,892
I'm going to rent an apartment,
somewhere and live by myself.

112
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,328
Are you really going to do that?

113
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:25,896
I've already decided.

114
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:28,199
After all, even I think it's
strange for me to live in

115
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:31,035
luxury with my parents' money
while I'm always complaining

116
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,404
about them all the time.

117
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:34,805
It made me feel sick.

118
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:35,973
But it's not easy...

119
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:37,074
You'll have to work part-time.

120
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,075
I'll find something.

121
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:39,710
You'll have to separate
the trash yourself.

122
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,511
I can do that much.

123
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:43,780
In that case, you can
eat my share, too.

124
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:45,749
Are you sure?

125
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,250
Go ahead, and eat.

126
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,753
I like people who willingly
take on hardship.

127
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,554
Although I don't like your dancing.

128
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,423
I don't like your dancing either.

129
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:56,426
Let's just enjoy our
"monja" today.

130
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:05,835
Friendship suits "monja", doesn't it?

131
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,440
I bought croquettes.

132
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,509
It's Akira's favorite.

133
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:16,412
Then maybe I should put green
onions and deep-fried tofu

134
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,314
in the miso soup tonight...
Akira likes that.

135
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:22,217
No matter what happens, if
you eat food that you like

136
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,153
for dinner, you'll manage
to get through somehow.

137
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:26,121
Hello...

138
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:27,956
Yes?

139
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:29,024
It's Naoko.

140
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:33,929
Welcome.

141
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,032
Thank you for yesterday.

142
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,168
I didn't tell Akira.

143
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,537
Thank you.

144
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,272
Shimada...?

145
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,107
Sano...

146
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,178
Why are you here today?
Is it for math again?

147
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,415
No... I wanted to
talk to you.

148
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,150
You do?

149
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,153
Come on in then.

150
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:13,367
You don't have to serve
tea or anything

151
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,002
Really?

152
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,137
Okay...

153
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,778
I'm a little worried, so
should I take a look?

154
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:26,446
Do that.

155
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,565
What did you want to
talk to me about?

156
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:54,006
Actually, yesterday...

157
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,077
I went to the amusement park.

158
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:04,316
I sat down on the bench in
front of the Ferris wheel.

159
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:09,221
Why did you do that?

160
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:17,429
I wanted to know
how you felt...

161
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:21,766
...when you waited all that
time for your father.

162
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,137
I felt like crying.

163
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,811
I could see a small
roller coaster,

164
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:36,380
and the Merry-go-round.

165
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,386
When I thought that's what
you were looking at while

166
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,390
you waited for your father...

167
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,229
So what about it?

168
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,198
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,909
I wasn't going to tell you about
going to the amusement park...

170
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:12,882
But I really didn't want to
hide anything from you.

171
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:22,425
That's why I'll never bring
up your father again, but

172
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:24,794
I wanted to tell you
what I did.

173
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:28,731
I'm really sorry.

174
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,170
What is it anyway?

175
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:39,374
Sano...?

176
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,778
Why did you do that?

177
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:46,048
Why do you have to
talk about that?

178
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,649
Sano...?

179
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,352
Go home!

180
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:52,087
Just go home!

181
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,990
What do you think you're
doing, Akira?

182
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,424
It's none of your
business, Hitomi!

183
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:57,659
That has nothing to
do with it, does it?

184
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:58,993
Just leave me alone!

185
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,328
Akira!

186
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,720
Wait, Akira!

187
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:04,032
What's wrong, Akira?

188
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:05,733
What happened?

189
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,268
Sano...?

190
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:12,907
I'll have you know...

191
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,242
That this is my
only father.

192
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:20,347
The father who abandoned
me never existed.

193
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,385
A father like that
isn't a father.

194
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,788
Wait, Akira!

195
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:29,256
Akira!

196
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:30,757
Come back, Akira!

197
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:32,659
Akira! Akira!

198
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,131
What happened?

199
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,633
Sorry about the
commotion...

200
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,369
Akira's hurting...

201
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:47,373
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt...

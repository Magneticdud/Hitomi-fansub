00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:07,879
Akira said that o ^0ay
his father took him to

45
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,350
Akira that one day
his* Iher took him to

46
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,288
the amusement parkin Arakawa
when Lie was five years old.

47
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:24,896
After Akira had idde all
the rides in the park,

48
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:30,736
his father said heyvastjoing

front oft e erns wheel.

50
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,978
He told him not to
move from there,

51
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,149
so he waited and waited for
his father to come back

52
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,023
Because he was told not to
leave the bench, he kept

He doesn't know if he s
dead or alive

60
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:41,773
Akira told that story
to Naoko, didn't he?

61
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:54,820
But, in her own way, Naoko
was trying to understand

Do that

159
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,071
What did you want to
talk to me about?

160
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,512
Actually, yesterday...

161
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,583
J went to the amusement Dark

162
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,823
I sat down on the bench in
. i M-.t.
Hum ui tilt: reifib wneei.

163
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,728
Why i you do that?

164
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,936
I wanted to know
how you felt

165
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,273
when you waited ail that
time for your father

166
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,644
I felt like crying.

167
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,319
I could see a small
roller coaster,

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,888
and the Merry-go-round

169
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,894
When I thought that's what
you were looking at while

170
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,898
you waited for your father

171
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,737
So what about it?

172
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,707
I'm sdrry

173
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,716
t wasn't going to tell
you about going to the

174
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,417
amusement park.

175
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:13,391
But!really idn'twantto
hide anything from you

176
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:22,934
That's hy I'll never bring
up your father again, but

177
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,303
I wanted to tell you
what I did

178
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm really sorry.

179
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
What is it anyway?

180
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,884
Sano 9

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,288
Why did you do that?

182
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,558
Why do you haveio
talk about that?

183
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,159
Sano ?

184
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,862
Go home!

185
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,597
Just go home!

186
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,500
What do you th nk you're
doing, Akira?

187
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,935
It's none of yo r
business, Hitomi!

188
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,169
That has nothing to
do with it, does it?

189
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,504
Just leave me alone!

190
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,839
Akira!

191
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Wait, Akira!

192
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,542
What's wrong, Akira?

193
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,244
What happened?

194
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,779
Sano 9

195
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,418
I'll have you know..

196
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,753
That this is my
only father.

197
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,859
The iather who abandoned
me never existed

198
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,896
A father like that
isn't a father

199
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,299
Wait, Akira*

200
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,767
Akira!

201
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,269
Come back. Akira!

202
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,171
Akira! Akira!

203
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,643
What happened?

204
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,144
Sorry about the
commotion

205
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,881
Akira s hurting

206
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,886
But there's nothing we can
do to stop the hurt

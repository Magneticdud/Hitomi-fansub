Eat up!*Eat<ots.

189
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,589
Instead of a training
camp, this is more

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,325
like spending the night 1 a
relative s house isn't it?

191
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,661
It is, isn't it?

192
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,329
Since there are
children here

193
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,032
Have you lived in Tokyo
all your life?

194
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,600
Since I was born

195
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,670
I gu Iss someone like !you
wou
Idn't understand how

196
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:50,108
much someone like ine would
long to come to Tokyo

197
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,079
Like attaining success
in the world?

198
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,047
I guess it's iike that.

199
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,019
I To me, Tokyo is a stage.

200
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,422
Everyone is competing
for the spotlight

201
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,291
to shine on them

202
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,461
Once/ou gel up Vi the
stage, you t go

203
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,864
backstage Util you create
a moment of excitement

204
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,735
! think! understand
it's so like you.

205
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,105
jfou don't feel that way,
do you,+litomi?

206
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,874
Even though you're one of us
who came to Tokyo

207
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,509
didnt think
that far

208
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,214
I like when everyone is
working hard together

209
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,650
If the girls I was dancing
with didn't quit, think

210
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,919
would still be
in Sapporo

211
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,856
Why did they quit?

212
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,192
They found full-time jobs

213
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,795
If they looked at reality,
it was better to find

214
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,164
something normal rather
than hip hop

215
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,967
They wer^n'i^yrpna.

216
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,570
tried that my s If

217
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:58,042
But the difference was that
couldn'£<gtve t*ip

218
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,181
That's why I'm going
to do my best

219
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,287
What is it?

220
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,322
A iSincloth...

221
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,093
Loincloth.

222
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,399
What do you think
you r Tl ing*

223
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,202
What's wrong?
What happened?

224
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,973
Why are you hanging up
loincloths dressed

225
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,275
in your loincloth?

226
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,676
There are girls here.

227
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,711
I wasn't thinking

228
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,348
This is my summer
casuaiweaf.

229
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,553

co-ed party.

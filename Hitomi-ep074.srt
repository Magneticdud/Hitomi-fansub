CHAPTER 13
The Birth of ROSE MARY
Episode 74

2
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,661
*Hitomi and friends' dance camp
in Tsukishima had begun

3
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,163
*Hitomi, we're going to start
eating before you

4
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:45,237
*Go right ahead
This looks delicious!

5
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,339
*OK, let's eat.

6
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:54,246
*Hello!

7
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,515
*Come on in.

8
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,349
*Hitomi! We brought provisions

9
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,017
*Thank you! Please serve them.

10
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,286
*Oh, you're eating somen...

11
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:02,354
*

12
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,090
*What about your stores?

13
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,460
*I'm taking summer vacation.
Dad ...

14
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:09,628
*I left things in my brother's hands
and came over.

15
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,530
*You just came to make trouble
for the girls, didn't you?

16
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,065
*Here you go, try these

17
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,433
*They look great, thanks!

18
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,836
*Let's eat 'em!

19
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:19,872
*So, we wanted to put this out there

20
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,877
*We...

21
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:31,550
*Drinking party at Big Brother/Little Brother Monja

22
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,887
*Tomorrow?

23
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,721
*We know you're all so busy
We wanted to schedule for a free moment

24
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,826
*"Wonderful single guys are
waiting for all of you"

25
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:54,072
*What the heck is that?

26
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,908
*It's me and a guy I went to school with, 
and then the two store brothers..ta da!

27
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:02,514
*Hey, it's all you can drink and all you can eat, right?

28
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,315
*What should we do? 

29
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,016
*Well, it's free...

30
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:04,483
*And it's all you can eat...

31
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,984
*Want to go check it out?

32
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,419
*Well, if everyone wants to...

33
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,253
*OK, we accept!

34
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,756
*Great, we'll be waiting for you!

35
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:18,730
*How about me, shall I go along?

36
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:19,064
*Um, Ume, you're not included.

37
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,232
*Oh, is that so...

38
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:20,666
*Oh yeah, Hitomi, Mari said 
to take some

39
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,102
*of the food to Katsu
in the hospital

40
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:25,771
*Got it, I'll take it there

41
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,540
*

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:34,112
*

43
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,814
*

44
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,117
*Really, you're performing
in this?

45
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,618
*That's great, Hitomi

46
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:40,385
*Please win the 500,000 yen!

47
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,557
*I'd like to but the other two

48
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,928
*want to perform individually

49
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,298
*See where it says
Individual Award

50
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,469
*We need to all come
together with one feeling...

51
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,070
*Hitomi, what do you want to do?

52
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,137
*I want to compete as a team,

53
00:03:59,372 --> 00:03:59,972
*really come together tightly

54
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:00,772
*and knock the enemy out

55
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:04,142
*The time we danced the 
Mambo Matsuri, that felt possible

56
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,844
*It was so fun, and like 

57
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,816
*we could dance mindlessly

58
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,484
*

59
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,152
*That's what happens during a festival

60
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,821
*

61
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:21,660
*Everyone becomes like kids

62
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,597
*It's great if you can do that, Hitomi

63
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,836
*If I did what?

64
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,704
*You don't know this yet, but

65
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:33,739
*your grandpa is amazing during the festival.

66
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:34,439
*In this loud voice,

67
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,778
*oya - soya - oya - soya

68
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,382
*his enthusiasm for the festival

69
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,050
*overflows from his body

70
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:46,618
*like a whirlpool

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,219
*

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,856
*

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,524
*

74
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,559
*Your Grandpa's that kind of person
75
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,695
*If it's Hitomi, you can do it!

76
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,866
*It's your homework [problem to resolve]

77
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,534
*What is?

78
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,504
*Bring everyone's feelings together

79
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,705
*as one, and make them
all true comrades

80
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,140
*Right, isn't that it?

81
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,075
*

82
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,811
*

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,517
*Wow, just like Mari!

84
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:25,557
*And you know what else she said?

85
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,761
*What's that?

86
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,330
*That the enthusiasm from your body
during the festival is amazing

87
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,398
She said I'm the grandchild of that 
kind of person

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,067
*That's an impressive compliment

89
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:41,740
*So, basically without

90
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,975
*thinking about it too hard

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,911
*Go for it and form a dance unit

92
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:46,678
*Yes, good. That "hip hop" is sort of

93
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,513
*like carrying the portable shrine

94
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,050
*

95
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,087
*When you're jumping and flying around,

96
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,022
*it's something like the festival, isn't it?

97
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,858
*

98
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,328
*Oh, yeah it is

99
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,765
So you become the center of
the whirlpool

100
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,335
and draw the people around you
into it with you.

101
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:15,173
You can do it. After all, 
you're my granddaughter.

102
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,309
You're right.

103
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,945
Katsutaro, I'm here to
take your temperature

104
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,619
Ah, temperature, thank you!
Ms Miura, 

105
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,723
That guy with the neck wrap, 
and the fella with the bum arm,

106
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,059
and the teacher with the head injury

107
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,260
Can they eat mizuyoukan (bean jelly)?

108
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,528
Yes, that's fine.

109
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,165
Hey, from the old guy with the bad leg,

110
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,733
I have a present for the three
of you: bean jelly!

111
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,471
See how popular I am.

112
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,207
It's not you, it's the bean jelly.

113
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,709
You're very blunt, aren't
you, Ms Miura?

114
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,743
You're very blunt, aren't
you, Ms Miura?

115
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,794
Rose...

116
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,916
I have our name..

117
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,019
Our name!

118
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,972
Our starting points are
Rose's studio and

119
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,441
Mari's Matsuri Mambo.

120
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,876
So we'll call ourselves
ROSE MARY

121
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,144
Ah, I get it!

122
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,879
*

123
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,415
I like it.. It's
very feminine

124
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,484
What about you, Yuka?

125
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,952
OK with me

126
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,353
If it's OK with
all of you

127
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,024
I don't want to forget
that feeling of

128
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,962
dancing mindlessly, and
coming together as one.

129
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,599
The individual award is
good, and we should aim

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,168
for winning the contest.

131
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,270
Let's aim for both
and try our hardest!

132
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,339
Together, that's 700,000 yen

133
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,508
So, sounds like that's
the plan!

134
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,781
ROSE MARY!

135
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,656
They started their
afternoon practice

136
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,358
in a cheerful mood.

137
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,127
They put whatever ideas

138
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,396
together to create
ROSE MARY's dance

139
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,904
That's good

140
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,305
You were all great

141
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,476
I came with a move
*b felbu b

142
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,212
Watch this, ready?

143
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,250
*

144
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,060
Umm, Junko?

145
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,330
Why does it seem like you're
trying to mimic idols

146
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,898
from a long time ago?

147
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,001
I thought it would
be good

148
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,037
That's not the point

149
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,371
It's silly!

150
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,806
It's not silly!

151
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,808
I really worked hard
to come up with that

152
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,143
Now... now.

153
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,945
You mean you liked
what she did?

154
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,112
No, but

155
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,016
I thought it was
pretty good

156
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,551
You just have
bad taste

157
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,354
Your moves are just
the same pattern

158
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,189
Yuka... Junko

159
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,557
We just decided on
our name, so let's

160
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,292
try to get along.

161
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,566
Good work for the first day
of our training camp.

162
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,336
We worked hard,
didn't we.

163
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,371
We got the first
half done already.

164
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,505
I guess..

165
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm hungry

166
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,342
Shall we eat?

167
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,443
Good idea.

168
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,877
I want to eat "gyoza"

169
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,813
Sounds good to me!

170
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,481
Shall we have
gyoza then?

171
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,284
Let's eat gyoza and do
our best again tomorrow

172
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,435
Yeah! Good answer!

173
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,213
What do you think of
Otsunomiya gyoza?

174
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,714
It's delicious!

175
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,182
It is, isn't it?

176
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,651
Just remember

177
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,585
Ready?

178
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,353
Gyoza town...
Utsunomiya

179
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,722
Gyoza town...
Utsunomiya

180
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,324
Very good

181
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,992
You're forcing them
to say that.

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,762
Then, what's the ramen
noodle town...

183
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,929
Sapporo!

184
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,698
What's monja town?

185
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,832
Tsukishima!

186
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,201
Please remember!

187
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,977
It's delicious.

188
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,346
Eat up! Eat lots.

189
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,589
Instead of a training
camp, this is more

190
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,325
like spending the night at a
relative's house, isn't it?

191
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,661
It is, isn't it?

192
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,329
Since there are
children here

193
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,032
Have you lived in Tokyo
all your life?

194
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,600
Since I was born

195
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,670
I guess someone like you
wouldn't understand how

196
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:50,108
much someone like me would
long to come to Tokyo

197
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,079
Like attaining success
in the world?

198
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,047
I guess it's iike that.

199
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,019
To me, Tokyo is a stage.

200
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,422
Everyone is competing
for the spotlight

201
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,291
to shine on them

202
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,461
Once you get up on the
stage, you can't go

203
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,864
backstage until you create
a moment of excitement

204
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,735
I think I understand. 
It's so like you.

205
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,105
You don't feel that way,
do you, Hitomi?

206
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,874
Even though you're one of us
who came to Tokyo

207
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,509
I didnt think
that far

208
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,214
I like when everyone is
working hard together

209
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,650
If the girls I was dancing
with didn't quit, I think

210
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,919
I would still be
in Sapporo

211
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,856
Why did they quit?

212
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,192
They found full-time jobs

213
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,795
When they considered reality,
it was better to find

214
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,164
something normal rather
than hip hop

215
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,967
They weren't wrong.

216
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,570
I tried that myself in an office

217
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:58,042
But the difference was that
I couldn't give it up

218
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,181
That's why I'm going
to do my best

219
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,287
What is it?

220
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,322
A loincloth...

221
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,093
Loincloth.

222
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,399
What do you think
you're doing?

223
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,202
What's wrong?
What happened?

224
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,973
Why are you hanging up
loincloths dressed

225
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,275
in your loincloth?

226
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,676
There are girls here.

227
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,711
I wasn't thinking

228
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,348
This is my summer
casual wear.

229
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,553
Do I forget about tomorrow's
co-ed party.

230
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,656
Wear some ciothes before
you say that

231
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,291
I'm sorry

232
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,259
Please calm down.

233
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,162
I'm counting on
all of you

234
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,597
Good night

235
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,270
We have to get up early
tomorrow, so hurry

236
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,438
and hang these up

237
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:02,740
1

238
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,881
Moe!

239
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,552
Hang in there

240
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,026
Hang in there, Moe!

241
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,741
It's eight days until
the summer dance contest.

242
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,546
It looks like ROSE MARY is
starting to get on track

# Hitomi-fansub
Hitomi is the 78th NHK Asadora, in 156 episodes. English subs are not available, so this project is doing it, retiming for the raws available on nyaa

## Subs

The subtitles for the first 36 episodes were done by Akoya Fansubs. Those subs are available on [D-Addicts](http://www.d-addicts.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=161623). Here you will find from 37 onwards.

You can see each download from the [Releases](https://github.com/Magneticdud/Hitomi-fansub/releases) page

## Branches

Each week, once is final version, is kept in a different branch. The main (master) branch contains only the "work in progress". Links to the branches:

* [Week 7](https://github.com/Magneticdud/Hitomi-fansub/tree/Week7)
* Week 8
* ...
* [Japanese subs for eps 1-30](https://github.com/Magneticdud/Hitomi-fansub/tree/Nihongo) - extracted by [rokonoko](http://www.d-addicts.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=60234)

## How it works

Hardsubs are extracted with VideoSubFinder. The file has a lot of OCR errors that have to be fixed. Then, the timing of the subs usually are different compared with the raws available on nyaa, so it need to be fixed also. One episode at a time will be committed.

## Contributing

If you notice some errors, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/Magneticdud/Hitomi-fansub/issues) and I will fix it. If you want to fix a whole sub, you can submit pull requests. If you want to join the project, you're welcome.

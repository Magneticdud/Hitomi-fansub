10
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,589
It made me realize that
I have to wo *k harder.

11
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,657
It wasla good train ng
for you then

12
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,094

What did you want
to tell me?

16
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,045
You know when I went to
Atami to dance for a

17
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,981
part-time job

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,250
And ?

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,418
an i to t "te most
unexpected person.

20
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,554
Who?

21
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,657
Mr. Katsumata

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,160
What a coincidence!

23
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,195
Did you go up and
talk to him?

24
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,830
No I didn't

25
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,999
Why didn't you? He's going
to be like a member of

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,634
our family soon

27
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,471
He was with a woman.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,806
A woman?

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,112
They were wearing cbtton
kimono and they were

30
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,514
arm-in-arm.. Like this

31
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,553
Who was it?

32
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,424
Probably his lover

33
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,298
Hitomi. What are
you saying?

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,936
Katsumata is getting
^ rried to Keiko

35
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,938
That's right

36
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,874
That's why I want you to
tell Kteiko Jo r insider

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,009
about this m triage.

38
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,813
Wait a minute! What are
you saying. Hitomi?

39
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,750
When was it you "Went to Atami
for that part-time job?

40
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,620
This past Saturday..

41
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,424
Keiko said that Mr. Katsumata
was on a business trip to

42
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,960
the Kansai area this
past Saturday.

43
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,330
That's what he tol Keiko

44
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,069
Are you saying..

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,339
thati<atsumata is
tJeceiving Keiko?

46
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,908
That's right. He is.

47
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,144
You're mistaken.

48
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,280
It yrasnt him

49
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,182
You're mistaken. Hitomi.

50
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,485
When you ^aw Katsumata
in Atami. were you

51
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,420
close by, or far away ?

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,022
It was far away..

53
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,792
f it was far away it might
have just looked like him

54
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,129
so you could have easily
been mistaken.

55
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,932
Tho to things appen
all the im

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,034
No... I'm sure it was
Mr. Katsumata

57
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,169
! saw him with my
ownt fc yes

58
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,872
He was just h to <and
he promised me that

59
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:38,677
he would gnrTfte ko a home
filled with warmth

60
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,313
ou heard him. didn't you?

61
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,449
1 did. I hfeaH, but
he was there

62
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,552
Listen to me.

63
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,589
That man's face wasn 't
the fate of a man

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,190
who was lying

65
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,626
I looked right into
his eyes..

66
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,995
That's why I Jbeii§ved him

67
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,331
I thougll it was unfortun 1e
*%that he didn'tlook Jike

68
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,199
he could carry a portable
shrine, but I believed

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,036
that he could m T<e
Keiko happy

70
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,106
And now you're trying
to tell me that he

71
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,043
was arm-m-arm with another
woman in Atami...?

72
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,477
Don't be ridiculous!

73
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,013
If Katsumata said he went
on a business trip, then

74
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,448
that's where he was.

75
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,253
Is this what you
wanted to tell me?

76
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,521
it's too ridiculous!

77
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,222
I'm going to
take a bath

78
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,626

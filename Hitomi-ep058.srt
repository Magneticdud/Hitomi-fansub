Trying too hard to find happiness
Episode 58

2
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,229
Thanks for the food

3
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,264
Let's play cards, Akira

4
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,133
Okay, but just one game

5
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,168
Be sure you finish your homework

6
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:51,343
So you ran into Keiko at the orphanage

7
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,347
She was there to tell them she was getting married.

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,282
I'll bet everyone was

9
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,453
As you'd expect, everyone there is warm-hearted, aren't they?

10
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,589
It made me realize that I have to try harder.

11
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,657
It was a good training for you then

12
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,094
And.

13
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,897
I have something to tell you

14
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,765
What is it?

15
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,240
What did you want to tell me?

16
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,045
You know when I went to Atami to dance for a

17
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,981
part-time job

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,250
And ?

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,418
And I ran into the most unexpected person.

20
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,554
Who?

21
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,657
Mr. Katsumata

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,160
What a coincidence!

23
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,195
Did you go up and talk to him?

24
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,830
No I didn't.

25
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,999
Why didn't you? He's going to be like a member of

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,634
our family soon

27
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,471
He was with a woman.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,806
A woman?

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,112
They were wearing cotton kimono and they were

30
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,514
arm-in-arm.. Like this

31
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,553
Who was it?

32
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,424
Probably...his lover...

33
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,298
Hitomi. What are you saying?

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,936
Katsumata is getting married to Keiko

35
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,938
That's right

36
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,874
That's why I want YOU to tell Keiko

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,009
to reconsider this marriage.

38
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,813
Wait a minute! What are you saying. Hitomi?

39
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,750
When was it you went to Atami for that part-time job?

40
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,620
This past Saturday..

41
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,424
Keiko said that Mr. Katsumata was on a business trip to

42
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,960
the Kansai area this past Saturday.

43
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,330
That's what he told Keiko

44
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,069
Are you saying..

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,339
that Katsumata is deceiving Keiko?

46
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,908
That's right. He is.

47
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,144
You're mistaken.

48
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,280
It wasnt him

49
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,182
You're mistaken. Hitomi.

50
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,485
When you saw Katsumata in Atami, were you

51
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,420
close, or far away?

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,022
It was far away..

53
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,792
If it was far away it maybe just looked like him

54
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,129
so you could have easily been mistaken.

55
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,932
Those things happen all the time

56
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,034
No... I'm sure it was Mr. Katsumata

57
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,169
! saw him with my own eyes

58
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,872
He was just here and he promised me that

59
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:38,677
he would give Keiko a home filled with warmth

60
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,313
You heard him, didn't you?

61
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,449
I did. I heard, but he was there!

62
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,552
Listen to me.

63
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,589
That man's face wasn't the fate of a man

64
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,190
who was lying

65
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,626
I looked right into his eyes.

66
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,995
That's why I believed him!

67
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,331
I thought it was unfortunate that he didn't look like

68
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,199
he could carry a portable shrine, but I believed

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,036
that he could make Keiko happy

70
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,106
And now you're trying to tell me that he

71
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,043
was arm-and-arm with another woman in Atami...?

72
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,477
Don't be ridiculous!

73
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,013
If Katsumata said he went on a business trip, then

74
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,448
that's where he was.

75
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,253
Is this what you wanted to tell me?

76
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,521
It's too absurd!

77
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,222
I'm going to take a bath

78
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,626
Wash the dishes, and while you're at it, 

79
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,561
wash your suspicious nature, too

80
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,934
Hitomi. Order is ready.

81
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,970
Miso mackerel, right?

82
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,340
Here's your miso mackerel.

83
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,109
I ordered the deep fried horse mackerel

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,343
not the miso mackerel.

85
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,612
That was a medium bowl large serving with an egg.

86
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,780
pickled vegetables...?

87
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,415
I ordered a large bowl medium serving with

88
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,083
extra, extra pickles

89
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,085
It's totally different

90
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,720
Is something wrong?

91
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,088
I'll exchange it right away

92
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,790
I'm sorry

93
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,725
What's wrong, Hitomi?

94
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,694
This is the third time today

95
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,229
I'm sorry.. I'll fix it

96
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,530
No. I'll do that.

97
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,432
Take care of the counter

98
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,567
I'm sorry

99
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,670
Here's your salted mackerel

100
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,240
If you're troubled about something, you can talk

101
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,608
to me about it

102
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,112
Bu you're the last person I would talk to, Yuzo.

103
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,381
Just a minute!

104
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,616
What do you mean by that?

105
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,351
She has no faith in you.

106
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,519
What are you saying?

107
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,887
An honest man like me?

108
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,155
Right guys?

109
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,391
Why're you looking away?

110
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,260
You all trust me, don't you?

111
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,730
Look at that! No one trusts you

112
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,165
Hitomi

113
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,637
You're not focusing at all today

114
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,939
Go, sit down.

115
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,908
You're bothering the other students

116
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,443
so go, and sit down

117
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,646
I'm sorry

118
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,621
I'm sorry, once more everyone

119
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,865
You mean what you told us about in Atami?

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,367
That's right

121
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,803
Did you tell Keiko?

122
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,139
I did. I even told Grandpa.

123
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,075
But both of them told me that I was wrong, and they

124
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,343
won't believe me

125
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,113
But it's not something for you to worry so much about, is it?

126
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,048
That's right, it's not

127
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,754
That might have been a parting trip for him.

128
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,524
A "parting trip"?

129
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,058
I've heard of that

130
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,127
"I'm marrying someone else, so let's

131
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,563
end our relationship."

132
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,533
That's no good!

133
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,435
That means he's betraying Keiko, doesn't it?

134
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,572
Well either way, you told her about Atami so you

135
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,108
already fulfilled your responsibility

136
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,077
After that, it's a problem for the two of them.

137
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,149
We have to go to our part-time job.

138
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,685
See you!

139
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,729
Keiko and your Grandpa just don't want to believe.

140
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,499
Since she's finally going to happy.

141
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,502
But I don't think she can be if she

142
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,203
marries a guy like that.

143
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,243
It's my mom.

144
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,945
Hello?

145
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,315
Hitomi? I think I can get home early tonight.

146
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,085
Do you want to come to my place and have dinner?

147
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,356
You can help me set up my bookshelves too

148
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,792
But I have to prepare dinner

149
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,461
Can't you do something?

150
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,363
Ask that stubborn old man

151
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,299
All right, I'll ask him

152
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,969
It's okay

153
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,706
If Momoko's asking you, then go and help her

154
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,742
She doesn't have any friends to help her move

155
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,846
Yuria... Hitomi said she'll be late, so

156
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,115
can you help me prepare dinner?

157
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,917
Sure!

158
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,353
Yuria said she'll help me

159
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,421
So you don't have to worry about us.

160
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,758
Okay, got it. I'm hanging up.

161
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,605
We got a lot done didn't we?

162
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,040
You worked hard.

163
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,042
Hard enough to get paid for it

164
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,710
Here's your pay.

165
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,846
It's a pretty good wine

166
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,582
My former boss gave it to me to celebrate promotion

167
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,653
Being the assistant branch manager is*|Uit 'fetoig

00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,089
Well, I guess.

170
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,958
Are you happy?

171
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,262
Actually being the assistant manager

172
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,064
isn't what I thought

173
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,999
It's a heavy responsibility

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,868
Trying to sell cosmetics that we only sold in

175
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,937
Hokkaido here in Tokyo isn't that easy

176
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,073
I go around to the department stores

177
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,609
everyday, but I haven't had any good responses yet

178
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,180
I just have to stick to it, keep trying to sell them.

179
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,817
Since the company pays for half of the rent

180
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,486
for a nice place like this, I feel pressure

181
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,656
to work even harder!

182
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,727
It's not easy, is it?

183
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,031
But I feel a sense of satisfaction

184
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,503
starting in sales, and moving this far up...

185
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,076
But I had to leave you alone a lot to do it

186
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,513
Shall we eat?

187
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,750
Cheers

188
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,058
I need your advice

189
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,061
About what?

190
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,331
About Mr. Katsumata, Keiko's fiance

191
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,105
Do you fee! like the father of the bride?

192
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,976
Feeling happy and lonely all at the same time

193
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,478
It's hard to relax.

194
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,480
Something like that

195
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,849
But aren't you glad that he seems like a

196
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,618
nice person, even if he doesn't look like

197
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,887
he can carry a portable shrine? That's what Yujiro said.

198
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,589
He definitely doesn't look like he can carry 

199
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,023
a portable shrine

200
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,658
but I never had any hope that he would

201
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,227
to begin with

202
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,497
As long as he takes good care of Keiko

203
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,866
and makes her happy

204
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,803
Have another drink

205
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,572
"Happy sake"

206
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,708
"Happy sake" (the song playing in the background)

207
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,187
It's exactly what you think it is

208
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,990
He was wearing a cotton kimono, and walking

209
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,425
arm-in-arm with a woman in Atami, wasn't he?

210
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,396
Both Dad and Keiko say that you're mistaken?

211
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,802
I guess they just don't want to believe it

212
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,670
They were both so happy about it

213
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,505
They've convinced themselves that Mr. Katsumata

214
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,307
isn't that type of man

215
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,142
He is that type...

216
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,944
After all, you saw him

217
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,314
Let's go and check it out.

218
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,715
Take me there

219
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,651
Where?

220
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,786
Mr. Katsumata's apartment.

221
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,289
If Dad and Keiko are going to be like that,

222
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,924
then we have to do something about it!

223
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,026
What are we going to do?

224
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,161
I'll think about it when the time comes.

225
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,497
Mom!

226
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,001
I can't leave it like that

227
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,738
After all, she's Dad's precious daughter

228
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,875
I'm going to get ready.

229
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,009
Wait for me

230
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,046
Are you really going?

231
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,090
Right here

232
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,495
But there's no light. Maybe he's not home yet.

233
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,365
Let's wait for him to come home

234
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,745
She's really going for it...

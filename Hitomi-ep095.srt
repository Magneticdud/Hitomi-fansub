econta term s
December i t

9
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,307
That's about a month
from now, isn't it?

10
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,142
That's right...

11
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,512
Let's treasure
each moment.

12
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,663
Study hard

13
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,434
Hitomi.

14
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,671
Just for a day... I'd like to
do something for Shota

15
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,674
I want to show him a
place that I like

16
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,810
It's OK... Where is it?

17
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,412
Tsukiji

18
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,682
Let's eat at the diner
you work at

19
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,985
That's a good idea

20
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,954
Maybe I should take him
to my dance school, too

21
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,356
I want to go, too

22
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,423
You do?

23
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,761
Then shall we take Shota
out just for one day7

24
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,774

25
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:56,675

26
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,113
It was Decembr 24th, and the
day was drawing near when

27
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,581
they would have to
part with Shota..

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
What do you think?

29
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,008
Are you surprised?

30
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,344
This is the spirit
of Tsukiji.

31
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,713
It was still dark when
everyone started

32
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,349
working, so by now
they're all starving..

33
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,086
Tsukiji men all take pride
in the work they do

34
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,256
Men pride themselves on
Icing \h&t Jives on

00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,926
their work and working
n arhfest, %o prow up

36
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,996
to be a man who takes pride
in what he does.

37
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,267
What are you having, Akira,
Yuria and Shota?

38
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,935
Miso mackerel, medium bowl,
large serving with extra

39
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,136
pickled vegetables

40
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,138
One miso mackerel medium bowl,
large serving with extra

41
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,273
pickled vegetables.

43
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,378
That was great

44
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,465
What do you think?

45
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,966
Isn't Hitomi cool?

46
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,268
She's cool

47
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,535
She is.

48
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,838
Everyone practices in
earnest like this..

49
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,606
That's why they can
have fun dancing

50
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,885
That's it

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,354
We have special
guests today.

52
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,857
Introduce them, Hitomi

53
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:03,101
Some of you may already
know but these are

54
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:09,374
the children I'm living with.
Akira, Yuria and Shota.

55
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,043
AYW T

56
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,212
I brought the three of them
here to show them how

57
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,648
earnest I am in
what do

58
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,627
I heard you're
good dancers

59
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,816
eM up'

60
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,317
This is o today

61
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,785
Formal?

62
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,822
We want Shota to remember
the taste of Tsukishima

63
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,523
It's ready!

64
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,425
Go ahead and eat

65
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,027
Let's eat.

66
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,667
Do they have "monja"
in Izu Oshima?

67
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,536
I wonder

68
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,305
They must

69
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,774
After all, Izu Oshima is
part of Tokyo, isn't it?

70
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,842
That's right...

71
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,077
Monja is a dish that's
representative of Tokyo.

72
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,048
Even if they do, you'll only
find this Tsukishima "monja"

73
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,216
here in Tsukishima.

74
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,218
That's right
very ie St (Fl ly

75
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,220
find our bran monja"
here at a u rant

76
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,859
You don't have to rush,
and eat it like that

77
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,993
Cool it off first...

78
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,995
I'm going to eat
lots of it.

79
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,263
Lots and lots of it.

80
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,766
It's your fault for
saying that

81
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,502
I'm sorry

82
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,237
Don't eat so fast.

83
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,721
Shall we go7

84
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,125

jttiMtej, iiiiiiiii?

89
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,506
But it's strange.

90
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,042
When I think that we were
raised by the same father

91
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,612
and mother, I feel like we're
brother and sister.

92
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,849
. .i jji.

93
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,084
I feel the same way ...

94
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,320
Yuria is my older sister.

95
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,889
Soy&u'fTlth

96
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,024
Then v ut 7

97
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,492
Am I the younger sister?

98
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,228
You're not like a sister...,

99
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,565
BdVV e ok like
our mother either..

100
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,302
Older brother!

101
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,504
You're right!

102
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,838
No, I'm not!

103
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,708
r 0
rea. lady-like

104
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,011
But you get along
really nice

105
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,180
You had a hard time
at the beginning

106
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:49,821
Shota... When I left that
house I was sad, but

107
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,356
it'll be OK

108
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,193
Dad and I will always feel
as though we're father

109
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,728
and daughter

110
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,301
Shall we go?

111
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,077
That night.. They had a
farewell party for Shota

112
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,328
Everyone's drunk already

113
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,932
Good evening

114
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,176
Rose, did you
know Shota?

115
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,178
We see each other
once in a while when

116
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,813
I was out walking,
didn't we?

117
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,483
Shota asked me aYe tly
ha question ion£?Tay

118
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,118
What did he ask you?

119
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,820
He asked me if I was
an uncle or an aunty.

120
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,256
What did you tell him?

121
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,793
Human being

122
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,899
Thank you for waiting.

123
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,310
Are you ready?

124
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:19,711

00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,982

126
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,556
Let me have
some first.

127
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,792
Wait a minute..

128
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,861
Shota wrote something, so
he's going to read it now.

129
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,407
My Memories of Tsukishima

130
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,209
j^roup one..

131
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,745
Some of my memories of
Tsukishima are sleeping

132
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,847
on bunk beds with Akira,

133
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,952
playing cards with Yuria,

134
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,856
Getting scolded and

135
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,759
taking a bath with Dad

136
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,197
I was sad when Mom died,
but Hitomi came, and

137
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,832
it was Ln again

138
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,804
Fixing meals with
everybody.

139
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,674
Eating meals with

Thank you all for helping
to raise me..

152

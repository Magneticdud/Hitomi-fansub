00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,661
Moe

6
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,096
Hitomi! Over there!

7
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,300
Kazu's cornered Ray,
trying to pick a fight

8
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,837
Hold on you...compete against us, 
don't run away.

9
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,772
We're not running away

10
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,575
There's no point in
talking to you

11
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,711
Call Ken over here.

12
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,714
Hey

13
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,849
What do you want?

14
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,916
Hitomi!

15
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,052
Are you harassing
Ray again?

16
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,888
Don't try to make me
look like the villain

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,158
I'm just telling her that
I want to avenge

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,361
my brother's death by settling
it on the dance floor

19
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,398
I want to show these guys that
we're better dancers

20
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,534
Mhan the

21
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,170
Kazu...

22
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,205
Ken!

23
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,009
Good timing

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,181
Why don't you tell the truth
in front of everybody?

25
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,218
Listen, everyone

26
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,254
Attention over here!

27
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:42,094
You all know who these
two are, don't you.

28
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,600
They're Ken and Ray from the
legendary unit, Cheapass.

29
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,805
My brother was a part
of that unit

30
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,477
Do you all know why
Cheapass broke up?

31
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,981
These two were dating
each other, and my

32
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:07,953
brother was in the way.
They drove him to

33
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,788
commit suicide

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,425
That can't be true!

35
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,363
That's not true,
is it, Ken?

36
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,238
Ray?

37
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,645
See? They can't
say anything.

38
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,883
All the dancers in Osaka
who were friends with

39
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,919
my brother said..

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,656
That there's no way that
someone who loved dancing

41
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,960
as much as Eiji would quit
dancing and die

42
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,564
They said it's all Ken
and Ray's fault.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,838
My poor brother was betrayed
by his best friend and by

44
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:05,677
the woman he loved, and died a
lonely death all alone.

45
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,559
Got it? Don't run away - 
compete with me.

46
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,543
Ken!

47
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,166
Ken!

48
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,539
That's not what
happened, is it?

49
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,409
No matter what
Kazu says..

50
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,111
The truth is completely
different, right?

51
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,017
Ken?

52
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,924
Please say something...

53
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,458
...

54
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,832
Leave it alone

55
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,072
You don't understand
anything

56
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,777
Then..

57
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,082
Is what Kazu said true?

58
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,197
I'm disappointed

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,869
Betraying your best friend
over something like that.

60
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,341
I'm disappointed

61
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,811
in you and in Cheapass

62
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,483
Yujiro's taking the day
off work?

63
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,052
Did Yujiro catch
a cold?

64
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,988
No - this morning as
we were leaving

65
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:07,793
he asked if I would meet 
with you all.

66
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,396
He said he wanted to
reflect on his life

67
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,232
He said that?

68
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,036
A lot happened while he was
the acting president

69
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,839
Didn't he lose his confidence?

70
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,975
When he said he wanted to
reflect on his life,

71
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,845
I thought that maybe
he's grown up a little.

72
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,148
Until now he's never once
reflected on his life

73
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,518
I hope he'll rest up and
come back in good spirits 

74
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,920


75
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,521
Exactly

76
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,925
By the way, doesn't Hitomi
seem out of sorts?

77
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,360
She's been like that
all morning

78
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,496
Probably something 
related to dancing, isn't it?

79
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,864


80
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,202
Welcome!

81
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,171
Yo!

82
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,909
I had the urge to eat the
miso mackerel here again

83
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,578
I'll have the lunch set.

84
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,780
Miso mackerel with extra
pickled vegetables

85
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,948
Coming right up

86
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,749
Thank you.

87
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,852
Can I sit here?

88
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,653
Sure

89
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,596
About last night - I thought
I should explain to you

90
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,336
I don't want you to
misunderstand Ken.

91
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,939
And I don't want to lose
the trust of my students

92
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,742
Can I talk to
you later?

93
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,111
Ray..

94
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,418
Ken and Eiji were
close friends

95
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,089
Close enough that it
made me jealous

96
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,329
There was never a love
triangle iike Kazu said

97
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:59,304
You mean there were no
feelings of love at all?

98
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,074
Why?

99
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:11,149
Because.. You're wonderful,
and it wouldn't be strange

100
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,353
for Ken and Eiji to have
those kinds of feelings

101
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,228
I'm happy that you
would say that

102
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,497
But there weren't
any at all

103
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,333
Not at all?

104
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,371
Of course, they both really
cared about me...

105
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,107
But as a dancer

106
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,611
CHEAP ASS was..

107
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,381
Genuinely three dancers
who came together

108
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,190
We respected each other,
and the unit that came

109
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,927
about was like a miracle.

110
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,966
It made me feel I
would never encounter

111
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,335
anything like it again

112
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:10,041
Then why did Eiji...?

113
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,084
I think he was jealous
of me and Ken

114
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,722
But if there were no
romantic feelings...?

115
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,692
It was jealousy
as a dancer

116
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,596
That was more painful to
Eiji than being

117
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,565
jealous of a lover

118
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,570
because dance was
everything to him.

119
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,342
He convinced himself
he had no talent

120
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,313
when he compared himself
to me and Ken

121
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,717
We told him it wasn't true,

122
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,819
But Eiji seemed to 
cross into a dark place

123
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,693
He started drinking every night


124
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,064
Gradually he lost his
vigor on stage.

125
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,536
Evidently, he started
telling everybody that

126
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,673
Ken and I were
dating each other.

127
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,881
He told us that we were
making a fool of him,

128
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,283
and threatened
to quit dancing

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,189
Ken grabbed hold of him
and told him many times

130
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,725
Don't say things like that

131
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,494
Keep dancing with us!

132
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,340
But he couldn't get
through to Eiji

133
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,548
He ran out, and drove his
motorcycle into the ocean.

134
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,853
That's when Ken
broke off from dancing

135
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,126
because he thought it was his
fault that Eiji felt hurt

136
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,866
Why?

137
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:15,867


138
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:23,308
Why won't you and Ken tell
everyone the truth?

139
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,515
Because Ken told me
not to say anything

140
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,887
Even when the rumors came
out that the reason for

141
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,423
his suicide was a
love triangle

142
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,426
Ken said "Don't
make excuses."

143
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,164
He thought it was better
than people knowing that Eiji

144
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,835
committed suicide because he
gave up on himself as a dancer

145
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,538
He as trying to uphold
Eiji's honor

146
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,541
He wanted people to believe
that Eiji loved dancing

147
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,177
until the end


148
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,083
It's also the reason he
doesn't say anything to Kazu

149
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,454
Ken wants her to have the
utmost respect for her 

150
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,423
big brother the amazing dancer

151
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,032
It's been more than
three years since

152
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,234
Ken last danced onstage...

153
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,272
He hasn't been able to free
himself from the past.

154
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,109
Even I think that Ken is
blaming himself

155
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,211
too much

156
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,184
But the truth is that KEN
and I continue to suffer

157
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,491
In order to overcome that,
I want the two of us to

158
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,594
dance together again.

159
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,634
I want to appear on Dance
Beat as Cheapass

160
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,545
Dancing is our friend

161
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,950
We didn't do anything
to betray our friend

162
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,156
I wanted you to
understand that.

163
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,170
That miso mackerel
was delicious

164
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,405
Thank you for the meal

165
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,776
Thank you taking the
time to talk to me.

166
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,313
I'll see you.

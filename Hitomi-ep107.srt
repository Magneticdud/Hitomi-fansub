"They're KEN and RAY from the

29
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,805
My brother was a part
of that unit

30
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,477
Do you all know why
CHEAPASS broke up9

31
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,981
These two were dating
each other, and my

32
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:07,953
brother got in their way,
so they drove him to

33
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,788

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,425

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,656
That there's no way that

much as EIJI w iiid quit
dancing, and die

42
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:52,564
They said it's all KEN

00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,336
I don't want you to
misunderstand KEN.

91

ay..

94
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,418
KEN and EIJI were
close friends

95
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,089
Close enough that it
made me jealous

96
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,329
There was never a love
triangle iike Kazu said

97
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:59,304
ou mean Ihere were no
feelings of love at all7

98
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,074
Why?

99
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:11,149
ecause.. You're wonderful,
and it woUldn t be strange

100
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,353
for KEN and EIJI to feel
Ifrli Y/aJ l

101
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,228
m happy that you
would say that

102
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,497
_J)utth re weren t
any at all

103
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,333
-Nottft all9

104
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,371

106
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,611
CHEAP ASS was..

107
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,381
enuin ly three dancers
ho came together

108
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,190
We respected each other,
and the unit that came

109
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,927
J about was like a miracle.

110
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,966
It made me fefel as if i
would never encounter

111
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,335
anything <ike it again

112
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:10,041
Then wh^ id EIJL.?

113
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,084
I think h6' Is jealous
of me and KEtf

114
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,722
But it had nothing to
do with love, did it7

115
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,692
t was jeaiousy
as a dancer

116
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,596
It was more painful to
iJI than being

117
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,565
je lous of a lover

118
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,570

127
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,881

taking him for a fool,

128
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,283
pnd^hreatened
40 quit dancing

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,189
KE abbed hold of him,
^mflola Jiim many times

130
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,725
o say things like
h' f<tarid that he

131
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,494
Yited EIJI to keep
Slicing with us

132
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,340
But he couldn't get
through to EIJI

133
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,548
He ran out, and drove his
motorcycle into the ocean.

134
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,853
That's when KEN
sto ped dancing

135
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,126
ecause e thought it vtas his
fault hat EIJI was hurt

136
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,866
Why ?

137
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:15,867


138
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:23,308
Why/von t you and KE f\l tell
eVeryon e*|ruth?

139
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,515
Because KEN told me
not o say anything

140
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,887
ven when the rumors came
out at the reason for

141
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,423
his suicide was a
love triangle

142
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,426
KEN aid we shouldn't
make excuses.

143
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,164
Hethougllltw ^t) 1t-1r

comltted suicide becau etie had
i/en up ho,^ !as a dancer

145
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,538
e as trying to uphold
Mi's honor

146
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,541
fte wan ed people to believe
t El I loved dancing

147
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,177
u lil the 1 end


148
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,083
he reason he


149
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,454
KEN ants her to have the
hig es espect for her

150
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,423
? the s a dancer

151
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,032
It's been more th Yi three
years since

Efl

152
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,234
danced onstage...

153
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,272
4Je hasn't been able to free
himself from the past.

154
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,109
tven ! think that KEN is
p tting too much blame

155
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,211
on himself

156
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,184
But the truth js that KEN
and ! continue to suffer

157
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,491

In order to overcome th^C
i want the two of us to

158
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,594

It's you that he needs.

14
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:41,166
You can give him what
my grandpa and I can't

15
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,575
Please live with Shota,
and raise him

16
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,823
Shota.

Mikie?

20
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,254
HlriTit. I'll be
waiting.

21
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,959
Ms Saito is coming
over here, and she

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,095
said she'll raise
Shota herself

23
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,997
Really?

24
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,300
But what happened?
It's rather sudden

25
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,103
She said it was
because of Hitomi

26
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,070
Hitomi?

27
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,139
Hitomi?

28
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:06,618
I'm really sorry for
sounding so unreliable

29
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,390
Let's talk this over
carefully

30
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,091
This way.

31
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,805
I'm very sorry.

32
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,274
Let's talk.

33
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,643
We called Katsutaro.

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,112
Follow me

35
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,414
This way

36
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,855
When I saw Shota clinging
to the towel blanket

37
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,025
and crying, I just
couldn't sit still.

38
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,763
Her fiance gave me her
address, so I went

39
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,334
over there without
telling Grandpa.

40
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,238
I Understand the
circumstances...

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,173
I'm really sorry

42
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,077
I apologize, too

43
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,080
She's young, so sometimes
she does things

44
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,948
without thinking

45
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,319
I understand that she was
thinking of Shota...

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,656
But of you made just one
mistake, Mikie may have

47
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,759
collapsed emotionally.

48
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,030
If that had happened, it's
possible that it would

49
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,933
haVe affected Shota's
whole life

50
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,737
The most important thing
is the child's future.

51
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,475
No matter what happens,
please don't forget that.

52
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,845
I understand. I'm sorry

53
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,647
I'm sorry

54
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,651
But I guess since Shota's mother
says she wants to take him in,

55
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,520
and raise him, it's OK.
It might take a while,

56
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,223
but please watch over
Shota the way you

57
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,458
always have until now.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,761
1

59
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,531
Thank you

60
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,405
I really feel bad about
what I did to Shota,

61
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,341
and the trouble I caused
everyone here, but

62
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:16,281
nuiii iiuvy uii, iiH yuiny iu
take a whole new outlook

63
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,550
and do my best
to raise him.

64
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,022
We're glad that you
feel that way.

65
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,392
We'll do all we
can to help you

66
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,728
Thank you.

67
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,332
But because of everything
that's been happening

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,601
before you live together
with Shota, I think you

69
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:40,172
need the time to sort
your own feelings out.

70
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,545
When a mother has doubts and
is troubled about raising her

71
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,780
child, there maybe
problems with the

72
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,083
mother's emotional state too.

73
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,552
You may be able to gain
more confidence by

74
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,787
thinking back to your
own childhood, and

75
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,090
your relationship
with your parents

76
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,729
^llim^ jo nljffo'ji

77
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,365

n e o uild a ood
rela to p i ota

79
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,469
for the future.

80
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,838
I'll do that

81
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,410
I'd like to ask your advice
about something

82
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,312
What is it?

83
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,751
Hitomi's been a great help with
what happened this time

84
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,821
Will I be able to meet with her
again, and talk to her?

85
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,391
We'll talk to Hitomi
about it, and if

86
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,461
she agrees, we'll probably
pres "nl when you meet

87
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,198
All right, please ask her.

88
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,175
Shota.

89
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,780
Your mom's no longer
that busy anymore

90
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,216
So she said she can
meet with you again.

91
00:06:59,519 --> 00:06:59,851
Really?

92
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,652
Really?

93
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,923
oingto tud "tiard
so she can be a good

94
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,960
mothe to you, so she wants
you to wait until then

95
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,669
Shota. Can you wait
a little longer?

96
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,839
I can

97
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,111
You really are a good
boy, aren't you?

98
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,022
I see. I'm glad

99
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,958
But I hope his mother won't
come out and say that

100
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,160
she doesn't want to
take him again

101
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,963
I think it'll be
OK this time

102

guilty about not doing

105
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:57,442
nlhin fdrTiim as a mother
for so many years

106
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,212
She thought Shota hated
her, and she couldn't say

107
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,381
with confidence 
she'll be a good mother.

108
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,618
Shota's something
like that too...

109
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,121
He thought the reason his
mother wouldn't see him

110
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,357
was because she
didn't love him.

111
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,627
It's hard being parent
and child, isn't it?

112
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,296
Even if you care about each
other, you just can't get

113
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,499
your feelings across
to each other.

114
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,439
What's so funny?

115
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,309
It sounded like a parent
and child that we knew

116
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,313
Are you talking about
me and Momoko?

117
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,716
Bullseye

00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,320

119
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,222
It's November
November 9, 2007

120
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,191

121
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,963
This is the 96th Ippongi

natto race
Ready, Go!

123
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,904
Make it stickier.

124
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,172
As you'd expect from
third-year middle school

125
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,674
student, and Akira..

126
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,842
He's quick

127
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,677
Faster and faster

128
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,245
It's getting stickier...

129
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,615
There goes grader
Oka Yuria..

130
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:15,153
Third grader Saito Shota's
catching up...

131
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,424
What's wrong, 20 year-old
Ippongi Hitomi?

132
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,527
Yours isn't getting
any stickier

133
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,596
Work harder!

134
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,332
Wonderfu!! That's
magnificent

135
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,208
In order to restore her
bond with Shota, Mikie

136
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,112
met with Ms. Inoue and
underwent counseling

137
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,984
to help prepare
psychologically

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,526
Shota has calmed down, and
patiently waited for the

139
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,995
time when he'd see
his mother again

140
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:08,540
Then one day, Hitomi got a
call from Ms. Inoue and

141
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,576
went to meet with Mikie.

142
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,183
We asked you to come here today
at Mikie's request, Hitomi

143
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,652
Thank you for coming

144
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,920
Were you busy?

145
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,521
Not at all.

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,358
How is Shota doing?

147
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,893
He's fine

148
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,897
Once he understood your
feelings, he felt secure.

149
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,567
He's not fighting with
his sister anymore

150
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,801
Really?

151
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,904
What about you?

152
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,641
Ms. Inoue and the others
have been listening

153
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,476
to me talk

154
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,213
We meet like this and talk
about her childhood

155
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,751
h s 15 that, I'm beginning
to understand myself better

156
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,555
I realize why I've always
been afraid to be alone

157
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,558
and why I'm always
relying on others.

158
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,665
When I was little

159
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
my parents divorced

160
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,274
They didn't get along even
before that, but

161
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:22,547
When I was in the fourth
grade, my father left

162
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,886
Why?

163
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,523
According to my mother,
he was disgusted with

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,359
Tokyo, and went back
to his family home

165
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,464
1

166
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,267
I was abandoned
my father

167
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,406
My mother found a boyfriend
right after the divorce,

168
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,309
and hardly ever came home

169
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,449
I was so lonely...

170
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,057
But I put Shota through the
same thing, didn't I?

171
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,762
I'm such a fool

172
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:18,503
Doing what I hated the
most to my own son

173
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,745
What is your mother
doing now?

174
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,515
She passed away

175
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,417
when I was 8

176
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,855
What about your father?

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,029
Her father is still alive, and
in his hometown

178
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,767
We've been recommending that
she go to see him once.

179
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,269
At a time like this, it's good
to have the support

180
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,637
of a family member.

181
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,772
It's OK.

182
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,974
He's probably forgotten
about me by now

183
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,210
Mikie

184
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,848
What's wrong?

185
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,252
This song...

186
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,724
It's Miyako Harumi's "Anko
Tsubaki wa Koi no Hanai"

187
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:54,499
When I was little, my father
used to sing it all the time

188
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,080
Mikie.

189
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,187
You really want to see
your father, don't you?

190
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,094
When something happens, I think
family is important

191
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,200
If you know where he is,
don't you think you

192
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,302
should see your father?

193
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,410
Thank you, but I'm not
going to see him

194
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,550
Let's not talk about
this anymore

You can give him what

Really?

24
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,300
But what happened?
It's rather^udden

00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,103

I'm really sorry for

00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,390
Let's talk this ver
Carefully

30
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,091
This way.

31
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,805
I'm very slry.

32
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,274
Let's talk.

33
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,643
We called Katsutaro.

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,112
Follow me

35
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,414
This way

36
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,855
When I saw Sh la clinging
on to the towel blanket

37
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,025
uandjcrying, I just
couldn't sit still.

38
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,763
^Her fiance-gave me her
address, so ent

39
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,334
pver there without
telling Grandpa.

40
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,238
I Understand the
circumstances...

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,173
I'm really sorry

42
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,077
I apologize, tbo

43
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,080
She's young, so sometimes
she does things

44
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,948
without thinking

45
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,319
I understand that's \ was
thinking of Shota...

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,656
But If you made ju l^ne
mistake Mikie may have

47
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,759
collapsed emotionally.

48
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,030
If th \ had happened, it's
possible that it Would

00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,933

00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,737
Thetaioit importanrthing

51
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,475
No Imatter what happens,
please don't forget that.

52
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,845
I understand.
a
sorry

53
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,647
I'm sorry

54
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,651
But I gue ^s since Shota s mother
says she wants to take him in,

55
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,520
and |aise him, it's okay
It might take a while,

56
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,223
but please watch over
Shota the way you

57
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,458
always have until now.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,761
1

59
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,531
Thank you

60
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,405
eally feel bad about
what 1 did to Shota,

61
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,341
and Jhe|rou 1e I caused
everyone here, but

62
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:16,281
nuiii iiuvy uii, iiH yuiny iu
take a wh 1e new outlook

63
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,550
and do jny best
to raise him.

64
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,022
We're a*> y hat

Thank you.

67
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,332
But because o jsvery ing
that's been happening

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,601
before you live together
with Shota, I think you

69
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:40,172
need the time to sort
your own feelings out.

70
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,545
When a mother ha "clou ts and
is troubled abdut raising her

71
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,780
child, there may&e
pro Terns iVith the

72
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,083
mother's emotional state too.

73
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,552
You may be ^ble to-gain
more confidence by

74
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,787
thinking back to your
own childhood, and

Wonderfu!! That's

135
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,208
In order to restore her
bdnd with Shota, Mikie

136
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,112
met with s. Inbue and
uriderv ent counseling

137
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,984
to help prepar ^
psychologically

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,526
Sh la has calmed down, and
patiently waited for the

139
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,995
time when he'd see
his mother again

140
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:08,540
hen-one day, Hitomi got a
dll fro iVIs. Inoue, and

141
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,576
-went to meet with Mikie.

142
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,183
We asked you to come here today
at Mikie s request, Hitomi

143
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,652
Thank you for coming

144
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,920
Were you busy?

145
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,521
Mot at all.

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,358
How is Shota doing?

147
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,893
He's fine

148
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,897
Once he understood your
feelings, he felt secure.

149
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,567
He's not fighting with
his sister anymore

150
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,801
Really?

151
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,904
What about you?

152
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,641
S inoue and the others
have been listening

153
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,476
to me talk

154
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,213
e/neet ikfe this, and talk
about her childhood

155
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,751
h s 15 that, I'm beginning
#> u aerstand myself better

156
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,555
I realize why I've always
bee raid to be alone

157
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,558
and why I'm always
e ying on others.

158
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,665
When J was little

159
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,833
m arents divorced

160
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,274
They didn't'Qfct along even
before that but.

161
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:22,547
When I wasiTTthe fourth
grade, my father left

162
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,886
Why?

163
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,523
According to my mother,
isgusted with

165
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,464

166
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,267
was abandoned
my father

167
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,406
My mother found a boyfriend
right after the divorce,

168
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,309
% and hardly ever came home

169
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,449
y a ">so lonely...

170
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,057
But I put Shota through the
same thing, didn't I?

171
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,762

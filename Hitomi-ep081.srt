CHAPTER 14
Mother Shows Up
Episode 81

2
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,426
So after taking it
under consideration,

3
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,970
we decided that she is
now qualified

4
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,889
to take Shota in
and raise him

5
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,310
I understand how
you feel, but

6
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,314
I want you to think
about Shota

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,320
Shota's mother is finally
able to make an

8
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,698
environment where she can
raise Shota properly

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,785
Excuse me, but
I'm leaving.

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,121
Hitomi!

11
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,664
I'll go affer her

12
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,207
It's okay...

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,462
I'll make her
understand

14
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,091
Vm sf>rry s le as

15
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,217
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,635
No, it's all right

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,935
I can understand how
Hitomi feels.

18
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,687
Tak gi!

19
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,356
Even if her living situation
has changed, she totally

20
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,234
abandoned Shota for more
than two years. I have

21
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,028
doubts about her love
for him as a mother

22
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,366
When a child e raised

23
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:44,037
rovide wha sista "te

24
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,332

26
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,005
Or
t we
live to I hem.

27
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,593
When you consider the
foster parent's feelings...

28
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,808
What we have to do now
is to accept how Hitomi

29
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,144
and Katsutaro feel.

30
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,983
ir^ra, srtitt?

00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,319
That's how l^feel every

I I

33
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,713
Have you calmed down yet?

34
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,760
How can I?

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,721
How can I agree
with this?

36
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,433
After all the care you
put into raising him

37
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,020
You're hopeless

38
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,900
Don't look like that in
front of the children

39
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,570
I know, but

40
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,289
I have to take Shota to the
child care counseling

41
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,582
center tomorrow

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,673
You should ask Shota if
he wants to see his

43
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,466
mother mot.

44
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,761
After all, you're
his father.

45
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,390
Do you think Shota will
be honest with me

46
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,642
if I ask him?

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,313
He'll worry about hurting
my feelings and he'll

48
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,565
absolutely refuse
to see her

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,613
The best thing is for
someone at the child

50
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,407
care counseling center
to ask him.

51
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,664
What is a foster
parent anyway?

52
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,128
It's too heartbreaking

53
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,021
That night, they had dinner
just like any other night

54
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,356
Is that right?

55
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,027
So you thought when they
said 'typho ikka," they

56
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,945
meant a typhoon family?

57
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,365
They didn't mean a family,
they meant that the

58
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,867
typhoon was passing
through

59
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,702
That's righit. After all,
kka" means family

60
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,162
So t ha a moihe

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,788

62
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,790
That would be terrible

64
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,586
Wouldn't they Hitomi?

65
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,087
That's right.

66
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,968
Hitomi didn't really
feel like laughing.

67
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm going up. Shota

68
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,188
Wait for me

69
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,856
Good night, Hitomi.

70
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,149
Good night.

71
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,321
Shota.

72
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,657
I have to talk with you.

73
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,119
Will you come with me
to the childcare

74
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,454
counseling center tomorrow?

75
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,247
Will Akira come, too?

76
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,290
1

77
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,416
What about Yuria?

78
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,043
No, just you.

79
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,921
So after school, don't
stop anywhere, but

80
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,339
come straight home

81
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,929
hi'ji *

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,027
I think he'll say he does
want to see her.

83
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,362
Why would he want
to see her after

84
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,572
she abandoned him
all this time?

85
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,118
Don't say that in front
of the children

86
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,661
I know

87
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,332
But I feel sorry
for Shota.

88
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,543
Being subjected to
this all for

89
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,420
an adult's selfish reasons.

90
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,506
I'm going to take Shota
by myself tomorrow

91
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,591
Why? I'm going, too

92
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,553
With that attitude, ave
Yio ioea wnit yoL' I ay

at the center

94
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,306
I'll be fine. I'm worried
about what will happen

95
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,225
look at that!

96
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,685
What are you doing?
My eyeglass case!

97
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,060
What are you doing?
My eyeglass case!

00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,488

99
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,701

101
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,331
The miso mackerel
is ready

102
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,629
Here's your miso mackerel

But I'll take it.

Hitomi! That's mine!

108
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,595
I'm sorry

109
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,221

Can you change my miso

medium serving to stew medium
bowl large serving?

114
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,608
Adults are so selfish.

115
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,652
What's wrong, Hitomi?

116
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,571
Don't take it out
on everybody

117
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,115
I'm sorry! I heard all
of your orders

118
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,950
So don't worry about it

119
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,371
What's wrong? you've
been acting strange all morning

120
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,666
i making mistakes on orders
and dropping bowls..

121
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,755
We're dine here, so why don't
you leave early today?

122
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,798
In fact, I insist on it

123
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,302
You're throwing the whole
place into confusion.

124
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,137
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,938
It's Shota's mother.

126
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,775
She shows up now and
she wants to

127
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,401
take Shota back

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,197
When did Shota come to
live in Tsukishima?

129
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,993
He was in the third term
of the first grade

130
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,162
before that, he was in an
orphanage, and was

131
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,830
going to a school nearby

132
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,334
How did he end up in
the orphanage?

133
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,003
It was really terrible

134
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,049
She brought him to the
child care counseling

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,052
center, and told them she
couldn't raise him anymore

136
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,762
and she wanted them
to take him in

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,682
It's a pure case of
child abandonment

138
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,184
She worked at nights, and
she never fixed his meals,

139
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,646
so Shota used to eat raw
n ant ramen noodles

140
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,025
But why did she suddenly
come back now?

141
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,446
She's getting married.

142
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,993
She said their income will
be stable, and she'll

143
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,078
be psychologically stable
enough to raise him

144
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,788
properly this time.

145
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,624
But shouldn't
you be glad?

146
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,335
After all, Shota will be
able to live with

147
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,878
his real mother

148
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,048
Are you taking his
mother's side?

149
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,302
I'm not taking her side,
but there must have

150
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,306
been circumstances that kept
her from raising him.

151
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,559
If her life was unstable,
then leaving Shota at

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,478
the child care center might
have been the right thing

153
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,566
But she didn't even contact
him in all that time

154
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,568
Normally, a mother
would do that?

155
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,111
She should have been worried
about whether Shota was

156
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,779
well or not

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,573
Doesn't it mean that she
doesnt have any love

158
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,116
for him as a mother?

159
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,745
You can't just say that
without reservation

160
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,122
Why?

161
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,666
She's his mother after
all, she wants to take

162
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,961
him back, and there isn't
a mother who doesn't

163
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,172
love her child

164
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,720
Even if that's true, then
it hasn't gotten across

165
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,805
to Shota at all

166
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,517
I wonder about that

167
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,274
What if it were you, and
I left you with someone

168
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:55,737
for two or three years when
you were his age?

169
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,742
Would you hate me?

170
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,551
In the end, Hitomi
didn't go to the

171
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,137
child care counseling
center after all

172
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,477
Let's take a break

173
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,772
Go over the parts where
you're not confident

174
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,652
Hitomi.

175
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,613
Is something wrong?

176
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,200
Your movements are
careless

177
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,160
If you're not careful
you'll get hurt

178
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,954
I'm sorry

179
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,607
I'm home

180
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,402
Where's Dad?

181

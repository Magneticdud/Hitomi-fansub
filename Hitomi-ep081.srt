_JWhat*w ^sve to "do now

After all 1h xare vou

37
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,020
You're hopeless

38
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,900
Don't loo^ike that in
front of the children

39
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,570
I know, but

40
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,289
I have to take liota to the
child care counseling

41
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,582

42
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,673
You should aslTShota if
he wants to see his

43
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,466
mother mot.

44
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,761
fter all, you're
hi ^father.

00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,642
ihjskedJiim?

47
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,313
fte'll worry about hurting
m^feelings jnd he ll

48
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,565
absolutely refuse
io see her

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,613
The best thing is for
someone at the child

50
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,407
care counseling center
to ask him.

51
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,664
What is a foster
parent anyway?

52
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,128
It's too heartbreaking

53
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,021
hat night, they had dinner
just like any other night

54
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,356
s that right?

55
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,027
So you thought when :hey
said 'typho ikka," they

56
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,945
meant a typhoon family?

57
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,365
They didn't mean a family
hev meant that the

58
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,867
typhoon was passing
through

59
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,702
That's ri lit. After all,
kka" means family

60
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,162
So t ha a moihe
nd a h

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,788
And children, loo

62
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,790

Wouldn't they Hitomi?

65
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,087
That's right.

66
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,968
Hitomi didn't really
feeNike laughing.

67
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,770

But J feel sorry
for Shota.

88
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,543
Being subjected to
this ail because of

89
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,420
an-adult's selfish reasons.

Shotas mother.

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,197
When tlid S ota come !o

He wa§^n the third term
of the first rade

130
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,162
be.ore th 1. e was in an
orphanage, and was

131
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,830
going to a school nearby

132
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,334
—flow did jie^Tid up in
the orphanage?

133
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,003
it was really terrible*

134
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,049
Shet)rought Jiim to the
child care counseling

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,052
cent T, and *6f lem she
ouldn't raise him anymo e

136
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,762
and tie wanted them
to take him in

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,682
It' ^ pure case of
child abandonment

138
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,184
She wftTked at nights, and
sh ever fixed his meals,

139
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,646
so Sho a used to eat raw
n ant ramen noodles

140
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,025
Butwh i s esu denly
ome back now?

141
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,446
She's etting married.

142
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,993
She saidti rincome will
be Tble, and shell

143
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,078
be psychologically 1&ble
enough o raise him

144
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,788
properly h\s time.

145
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,624
But shouldn t
oil be glad?

146
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,335
After ail, Shota will be
able to live with

147
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,878
hisfeai mother

148
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,048
Are you t *kin is
mother s side?

149
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,302
m not taking her side,
but there must have

150
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,306
beencircumstances tha ept
her from raising him.

151
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,559
If iier life was unstable
ihen leaving Shota at

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,478
the child care center Ight
havFbeen the right thing

153
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,566
But she didn't even contact
him in all that time

154
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,568
Normally, a mother
would do that?

155
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,111
She should have bee . worried
about whether Shota was

156
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,779
well or not

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,573
Doesn't it mean that she
doesnt have any love

158
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,116
for him as a mother?

159
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,745
You tant just say that
without reservation

160
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,122
Why?

161
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,666
She's his mother After
all, she Wants to take

162
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,961
him back, and there isn't
a mother who doesn't

163
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,172
love her child

164
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,720
ven if that's true, th n
it hasn't gotten a oss

165
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,805
to Shota at all

166
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,517
i wonder about that

167
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,274
What if it were you, and
1 left you with someone

168
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:55,737
for two or three years when
you were his age?

169
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,742
Would you hate me?

170
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,551
In the end. Hitomi
didn't go to the

171
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,137
child fere counseling
ce ter after all

172
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,477
Let's take a break

173
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,772
Go over the parts where
you're nbt confident

174
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,652
i omi.

175
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,613
is s thing wrong?

176
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,200
our movements are
careless

177
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,160
If you're not careful *
till gist hurt

178

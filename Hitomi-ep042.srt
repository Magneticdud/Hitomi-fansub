00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:08,821
HITOMI

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,410
CHAPTER 7
"Let's Be Friends"
Episode 42

3
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,400
Stop it!

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,340
Yuzo and Hitomi came to the
dance club to save Yuka

5
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,680
who had gotten drunk after
failing the audition.

6
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,010
Who the heck are you?

7
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,380
You won't believe
this, but...

8
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,610
This young lady and I...

9
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,650
...ate pot stew together.

10
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,020
So what about it?

11
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,150
That's why I'm taking
Yuka home.

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,920
Don't get in our way!

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,260
Old man!

14
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,690
Wait... Hold on...

15
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,330
We'll leave the rest
to you, Yuzo.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,540
Hey! You can't just
take her home!

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,450
Hey! Are you okay?

18
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,650
Yuka!

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,890
Are you ok?

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,990
Get away from me!

21
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,400
I don't care what
happens to me.

22
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,630
Don't say that. You need
to take better care of yourself...

23
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,740
I don't want to hear
any preaching.

24
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,270
You're probably
laughing at me.

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,810
The rich girl who rented a
studio to practice,

26
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,680
and still failed
the audition.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,680
My dancing is all just for a rich
girl's self satisfaction anyway.

28
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,290
So no one enjoys
watching me dance.

29
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,820
Isn't that what
you're thinking?

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,260
Don't talk like that.

31
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,830
If you say that, then you won't be
able to work hard at it tomorrow.

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,070
When I failed the audition,
and  went home, everyone

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,800
treated me like
nothing happened.

34
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,940
We prepared dinner like
we always do, and we

35
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,670
ate dinner like
we always do.

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,910
And for some reason, that
made me feel better.

37
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,610
It's like they were
telling me...

38
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,080
It's not important.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,020
No matter what happens,
life will go on like this everyday.

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,390
No matter what happens,
you can still cook nice, hot rice.

41
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm sorry, but I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

42
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,730
It's just...

43
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,500
...that you're not living
your life alone.

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,200
There are lots of people who
worried about you.

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,980
Lots of people want to dance
and be friends with you.

46
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,880
You're the one who's closing
your heart to everyone.

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,990
It's such a waste.

48
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,390
When you're that good
a dancer, you should

49
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,960
be able to enjoy
dancing more.

50
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,810
Is this where you were?

51
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,850
I looked all over for you.

52
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,980
You turned off your
cell phone...

53
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,250
Let's go home... Your
father is worried.

54
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,490
Never mind!

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,790
I'm going home on
the train today.

56
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,130
Hitomi...

57
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,460
What's your goal?

58
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,400
Next year's Dance Beat.

59
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,410
So you actually have
a real goal.

60
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,980
Miss Yuka!

61
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,070
That's right... No matter
what happens, it's not

62
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,740
like the world turned
upside down, is it?

63
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,980
Even if you failed
the audition...

64
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,280
Life will go on like
this everyday.

65
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,150
Isn't that right, Daisuke?

66
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,890
That's right...

67
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,420
That's what it means...

68
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,660
That's right.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,760
Even for me... when I lose all
my money at the horse races,

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,990
I feel like my life is over.

71
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,400
But when I come to work,
and I'm working like

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,730
crazy, before I know it,
I forget all about it.

73
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,570
And when Saturday comes
around, I'm raring to

74
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,400
go at it again.

75
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,240
That's not the same!

76
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,240
That's exactly
what it is.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,340
No, it's not!

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,710
Are you going to hit me?

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,150
Welcome!

80
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,550
KEN?

81
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,220
RAY told me that the miso mackerel
lunch set is really good here.

82
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,820
I can use this, can't I?

83
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,760
Sure... Are you sure you
want the miso mackerel?

84
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,130
Miso mackerel, medium bowl, large
serving with extra pickled vegetables.

85
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,840
One miso mackerel, medium
bowl, large serving with

86
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,770
extra pickled vegetables
coming right up.

87
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,250
Knowing that you like miso mackerel
gives me a sense of kinship with you...

88
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,920
Did you have something to
do in this area...?

89
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,520
I have a meeting after this,
but I wanted to tell you

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,260
something while I'm here.

91
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,590
You wanted to tell
me something?

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,830
Your dancing at the
audition wasn't bad.

93
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,930
Really?

94
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,800
Thank you.

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,200
You made a mistake, an you missed
the beat of the music in some places.

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,110
Your moves weren't that well-executed...

97
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,480
And you need
to build up your muscles.

98
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,850
Also, considering the
differences in your

99
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,420
height, you might have used
some different moves.

100
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,850
They're nothing but bad things.

101
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,530
But your dancing had the one
thing that was most important...

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,960
You were enjoying yourselves
when you were dancing...

103
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,300
It was fun watching the
two of you dance.

104
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,150
It really was good.

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,350
Please come back again.

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,520
And...

107
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,790
What?

108
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,550
Please tell me more about
when you were dancing

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,160
with CHEAPASS and when
you were in New York.

110
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,290
If we have the chance...

111
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,300
Thank you!

112
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,310
Good for one large bowl
at Morimoto Shokudo

113
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,850
Hitomi!

114
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,450
Have you seen Yuzo?

115
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,550
Yuzo?

116
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,290
I haven't seen him
since last night.

117
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,360
While I was in the bath, I think
he went out drinking somewhere.

118
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
I forgot all about it!

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,230
What?

120
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,730
Yuzo!

121
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,430
Where was he?

122
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,070
You idiot!

123
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,870
Where have you been?

124
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,680
What happened after that?

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,750
Hitomi...?

126
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,380
Here... have one.

127
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,190
I got to be real good friends
with those pick-up artists.

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,590
We were drinking
and dancing...

129
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,590
Bring him some water.

130
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,700
What's all the commotion?

131
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,700
Pull yourself together.

132
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,640
Dancing sure is fun!

133
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,690
Hitomi!

134
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,490
Rose!

135
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,790
I heard you failed
the audition!

136
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,260
I sure did.

137
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Thinking that you would win
the audition was a big mistake!

138
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Dancing isn't that easy.

139
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,870
I'll do my best!

140
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,680
Yuka!

141
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,950
What are you doing?

142
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,430
With so many choices, I don't
know what to get.

143
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,200
But they're all delicious.

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll take 100 grams each of  the
"shirasu" (young sardines)

145
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,240
and "kyarabuki".
(stalks of butterbur in soy sauce)

146
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,440
"Shirasu" and "kyarabuki"...?

147
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,960
For some reason, this town
is really soothing.

148
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,000
You...

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,270
...told me last night that even
though you failed the audition,

150
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,240
after eating dinner with everybody,
you felt so much better.

151
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,640
I don't have that...

152
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,620
Ever since I was little, I hardly
ever ate together with my parents.

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,720
In exchange, there was a
housekeeper who would

154
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,320
fix my meals for me
everyday...

155
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,530
Maybe that's why I got so
caught up in dancing.

156
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,600
When I'm dancing, I don't
feel the loneliness.

157
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,370
It's the same or me.

158
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,010
After my mom divorced my
good-for-nothing dad,

159
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,750
she used to work until
late everyday, so...

160
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,880
I always ate by myself.

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,690
Then you're lucky that you get
to live with that lively family now.

162
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,560
That's right, l am.

163
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,600
Can I...

164
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
...come by your house
for a little while?

165
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,310
Sure. Come to the house.

166
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,070
Grandpa will be happy
to see you.

167
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,980
Really?

168
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,280
Let's go.

169
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,620
I'm home!

170
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,490
I brought Yuka with me.

171
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,090
Hello...

172
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,930
I'm sorry about
the other day...

173
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,600
Our idiot neighbors had
to ruin things for you.

174
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,700
No... I should apologize
after all the trouble

175
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,570
you went through to fix the
meal, and I left early.

176
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,970
This is just a token
of my apology...

177
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,440
You didn't have
to do that...

178
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,550
I love "tsukudani".
(food boiled down in soy sauce)

179
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,380
Thank you.

180
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,720
I'd better be going.

181
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,190
Aren't you going
to come in?

182
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,120
I just came by
to apologize...

183
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,820
We didn't get to do
anything for you...

184
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,390
I'll be going.

185
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,900
I'll see her off.

186
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,770
Thank you.

187
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,640
Be careful!

188
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,250
Yuka!

189
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,720
Don't tell me you came
here just to apologize?

190
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,530
I don't like your dancing,
but I like your house,

191
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,360
and this town.

192
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,400
See you!

193
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,070
Thank you!

194
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,110
I'll see you in school.

195
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Hitomi felt like she had gotten
a little closer to Yuka.

196
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,840
Excuse me...

197
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,180
Did you want something
at your house?

198
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,950
No... it's nothing.

199
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,490
Who in the world
was that anyway?

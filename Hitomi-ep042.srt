CHAPTER 7
"Lets Be Friends"
Episode 42

2
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,500
Stop it!

3
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,440
Yuzo and Hitomi came to the
dance club to save Yuka

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,780
who had gotten drunk after
failing the audition.

5
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,110
Who the heck are you?

6
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,480
You won't believe
this, but...

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,710
This young lady and I...

8
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,750
...ate pot stew together.

9
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,120
So what about it?

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,250
That's why I'm taking
Yuka home.

11
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,020
Don't get in our way!

12
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,360
Old man!

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,790
Wait... Hold on...

14
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,430
We'll leave the rest
to you, Yuzo.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,640
Hey! You can't just
take her home!

16
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,550
Hey! Are you okay?

17
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Yuka!

18
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,990
Are you ok?

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,090
Get away from me!

20
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,500
I don't care what
happens to me.

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,260
Don't say that. You need
to take better care

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,730
of yourself...

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,840
I don't want to hear
any preaching.

24
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,370
You're probably
laughing at me.

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,910
The rich girl who rented a
studio to practice,

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,780
and still failed
the audition.

27
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,610
My dancing is all just for
a rich girl's

28
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,780
self satisfaction anyway.

29
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,390
So no one enjoys
watching me dance.

30
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,920
Isn't that what
you're thinking?

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
Don't talk like that.

32
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,460
If you say that, then you
won't be able to work

33
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,930
hard at it tomorrow.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,170
When I failed the audition,
and  went home, everyone

35
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,900
treated me like
nothing happened.

36
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,040
We prepared dinner like
we always do, and we

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,770
ate dinner like
we always do.

38
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,010
And for some reason, that
made me feel better.

39
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,710
It's like they were
telling me...

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,180
It's not important.

41
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,650
No matter what happens,
life will go on

42
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,120
like this everyday.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,650
No matter what happens,
you can still cook

44
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,490
nice, hot rice.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm sorry, but I don't have
any idea what you're

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
talking about.

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,830
It's just...

48
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,600
...that you're not living
your life alone.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,300
There are lots of people who
worried about you.

50
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,080
Lots of people want to dance
and be friends with you.

51
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,980
You're the one who's closing
your heart to everyone.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,090
It's such a waste.

53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,490
When you're that good
a dancer, you should

54
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,060
be able to enjoy
dancing more.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,910
Is this where you were?

56
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,950
I looked aII over for you.

57
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,080
You turned off your
cell phone...

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,350
Let's go home... Your
father is worried.

59
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,590
Never mind!

60
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,890
I'm going home on
the train today.

61
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,230
Hitomi...

62
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,560
What's your goal?

63
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,500
Next year's Dance Beat.

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,510
So you actually have
a real goal.

65
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,080
Miss Yuka!

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,170
That's right... No matter
what happens, it's not

67
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,840
like the world turned
upside down, is it?

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,080
Even if you failed
the audition...

69
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,380
Life will go on like
this everyday.

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,250
Isn't that right, Daisuke?

71
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,990
That's right...

72
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,520
That's what it means...

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,760
That's right.

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,860
Even for me... when i lose all
my money at the horse races,

75
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,090
I feel like my life is over.

76
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,500
But when I come to work,
and I'm working like

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,830
crazy, before I know it, 
I forget all about it.

78
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,670
And when Saturday comes
around, I'm raring to

79
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,500
go at it again.

80
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,340
That's not the same!

81
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,340
That's exactly
what it is.

82
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,440
No, it's not!

83
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,810
Are you going to hit me?

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,250
Welcome!

85
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,650
KEN?

86
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,850
RAY told me that the miso
mackerel lunch set is

87
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,320
really good here.

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,920
I can use this, can't I?

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,860
Sure... Are you sure you
want the miso mackerel?

90
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,870
Miso mackerel, medium bowI,
large serving with extra

91
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,230
pickled vegetables.

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,940
One miso mackerel, medium
bowl, large serving with

93
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,870
extra pickled vegetables
coming right up.

94
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,580
Knowing that you like miso
mackerel gives me a sense

95
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,350
of kinship with you...

96
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,020
Did you have something to
do in this area...?

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,620
I have a meeting after this,
but I wanted to tell you

98
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,360
something while I'm here.

99
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,690
You wanted to tell
me something?

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,930
Your dancing at the
audition wasn't bad.

101
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,030
Really?

102
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,900
Thank you.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,300
You made a mistake, an
you missed the beat of

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,210
the music in some places.
Your moves weren't that

105
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,580
well-executed... And you need
to build up your muscles.

106
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,950
Also, considering the
differences in your

107
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,520
height, you might have used
some different moves.

108
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,950
They're nothing but bad things.

109
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,090
But your dancing had the
one thing that was

110
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,630
most important...

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,060
You were enjoying yourselves
when you were dancing...

112
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,400
It was fun watching the
two of you dance.

113
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,250
It really was good.

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,450
Please come back again.

115
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,620
And...

116
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,890
What?

117
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,650
Please tell me more about
when you were dancing

118
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,260
with CHEAPASS and when
you were in New York.

119
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,390
If we have the chance...

120
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,400
Thank you!

121
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,410
Good for one large bowl
at Morimoto Shokudo

122
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,950
Hitomi!

123
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,550
Have you seen Yuzo?

124
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,650
Yuzo?

125
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,390
I haven't seen him
since last night.

126
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,030
While I was in the bath,
I think he went out

127
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,460
drinking somewhere.

128
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,260
I forgot all about it!

129
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,330
What?

130
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,830
Yuzo!

131
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,530
Where was he?

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,170
You idiot!

133
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,970
Where have you been?

134
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,780
What happened after that?

135
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,850
Hitomi...?

136
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,480
Here... have one.

137
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,290
I got to be real good friends
with those pick-up artists.

138
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,690
We were drinking
and dancing...

139
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,690
Bring him some water.

140
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,800
What's all the commotion?

141
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,800
Pull yourself together.

142
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,740
Dancing sure is fun!

143
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,790
Hitomi!

144
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,590
Rose!

145
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,890
I heard you failed
the audition!

146
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,360
I sure did.

147
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,900
Thinking that you would
win the audition was

148
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,300
a big mistake! Dancing
isn't that easy.

149
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,970
I'll do my best!

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,780
Yuka!

151
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,050
What are you you doing?

152
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,530
With so many choices, I don't
know what to get.

153
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,300
But they're all delicious.

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
I'll take 100 grams each of  the
"shirasu" (young sardines)

155
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,340
and "kyarabuki".
(stalks of butterbur in soy sauce)

156
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,540
"Shirasu" and "kyarabuki"...?

157
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,060
For some reason, this town
is really soothing.

158
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,100
You...

159
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,970
...told me last night that
even though you failed the

160
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,370
audition, after eating dinner
with everybody, you felt

161
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,340
so much better.

162
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,740
I don't have that...

163
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,780
Ever since I was little,
I hardly ever ate together

164
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,720
with my parents.

165
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,820
In exchange, there was a
housekeeper who would

166
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,420
fix my meals for me
everyday...

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,630
Maybe that's why I got so
caught up in dancing.

168
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,700
When I'm dancing, I don't
feel the loneliness.

169
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,470
It's the same or me.

170
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,110
After my mom divorced my
good-for-nothing dad,

171
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,850
she used to work until
late everyday, so...

172
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,980
I always ate by myself.

173
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,120
Then you're lucky that you
get to live with that

174
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,790
lively family now.

175
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,660
That's right, l am.

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Can I...

177
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
...come by your house
for a little while?

178
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,410
Sure. Come to the house.

179
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,170
Grandpa will be happy
to see you.

180
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,080
Really?

181
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,380
Let's go.

182
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm home!

183
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,590
I brought Yuka with me.

184
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,190
Hello...

185
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,030
I'm sorry about
the other day...

186
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,700
Our idiot neighbors had
to ruin things for you.

187
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,800
No... I should apologize
after all the trouble

188
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,670
you went through to fix the
meal, and I left early.

189
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,070
This is just a token
of my apology...

190
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,540
You didn't have
to do that...

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,650
I love "tsukudani".
(food boiled down in soy sauce)

192
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you.

193
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,820
I'd better be going.

194
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,290
Aren't you going
to come in?

195
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,220
I just came by
to apologize...

196
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,920
We didn't get to do
anything for you...

197
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,490
I'll be going.

198
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll see her off.

199
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,870
Thank you.

200
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,740
Be careful!

201
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,350
Yuka!

202
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,820
Don't tell me you came
here just to apologize?

203
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,630
I don't like your dancing,
but I like your house,

204
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,460
and this town.

205
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500
See you!

206
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,170
Thank you!

207
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,210
I'll see you in school.

208
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Hitomi felt like she had gotten
a little closer to Yuka.

209
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,940
Excuse me...

210
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,280
Did you want something
at your house?

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,050
No... it's nothing.

212
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,590
Who in the world
was that anyway?

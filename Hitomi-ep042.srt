Get away from me*

20
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,800
I don't care what
happens to me

21
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,569
D hi say that You need
to take better care

22
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,037
of yourself..

23
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,140
I don't want to hear
any preaching

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,675
You'rfe probably
laughing at me

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,212
The rich girl who rented a
studio to practice,

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,081
and still failed
the audition

27
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,919
My dancing is all just f V
a ich girl's self

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,088
satisfaction anyway

29
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,690
So no one enjoys
watching me dance

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,226
Isn't that what
yoiTre thinking?

31
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,664
Don't talk like that

32
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,766
If you say that, then you
won't be able to w

33
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,234

34
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,472

that you're not living
your life alone

You're the one who's "tbsing
your heart to everyone

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,391
It's such a waste

CHAPTER 7
"Lets Be Friends"
Episode 42

2
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,806
Stop it!

3
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,743
Yuzo and Hitomi came to the
dance club to save Yuka

4
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,080
who had gotten drunk after
failing the audition.

5
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,415
Who the heck are you?

6
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,783
You won't believe
this, but...

7
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,019
This young lady and I...

8
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,054
...ate pot stew together.

9
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,422
So what about it?

10
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,558
That's why I'm taking
Yuka home.

11
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,326
Don't get in our way!

12
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,661
Old man!

13
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,096
Wait... Hold on...

14
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,739
We'll leave the rest
to you, Yuzo.

15
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,943
Hey! You can't just
take her home!

16
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,853
Hey! Are you okay?

17
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,057
Yuka!

18
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,294
Are you ok?

19
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,396
Get away from me!

20
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,800
I don't care what
happens to me.

21
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,569
Don't say that. You need
to take better care

22
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,037
of yourself...

23
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,140
I don't want to hear
any preaching.

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,675
You're probably
laughing at me.

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,212
The rich girl who rented a
studio to practice,

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,081
and still failed
the audition.

27
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,919
My dancing is all just for
a rich girl's

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,088
self satisfaction anyway.

29
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,690
So no one enjoys
watching me dance.

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,226
Isn't that what
you're thinking?

31
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,664
Don't talk like that.

32
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,766
If you say that, then you
won't be able to work

33
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,234
hard at it tomorrow.

34
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,472
When I failed the audition,
and  went home, everyone

35
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,208
treated me like
nothing happened.

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,343
We prepared dinner like
we always do, and we

37
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,078
ate dinner like
we always do.

38
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,314
And for some reason, that
made me feel better.

39
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,017
It's like they were
telling me...

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,485
It's not important.

41
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,953
No matter what happens,
life will go on

42
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,421
like this everyday.

43
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,956
No matter what happens,
you can still cook

44
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,791
nice, hot rice.

45
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,060
I'm sorry, but I don't have
any idea what you're

46
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,228
talking about.

47
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,131
It's just...

48
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,902
...that you're not living
your life alone.

49
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,609
There are lots of people who
worried about you.

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,380
Lots of people want to dance
and be friends with you.

51
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,288
You're the one who's closing
your heart to everyone.

52
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,391
It's such a waste.

53
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,794
When you're that good
a dancer, you should

54
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,363
be able to enjoy
dancing more.

55
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,213
Is this where you were?

56
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,252
I looked aII over for you.

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,387
You turned off your
cell phone...

58
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,656
Let's go home... Your
father is worried.

59
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,890
Never mind!

60
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,193
I'm going home on
the train today.

61
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,531
Hitomi...

62
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,868
What's your goal?

63
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,806
Next year's Dance Beat.

64
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,811
So you actually have
a real goal.

65
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,387
Miss Yuka!

66
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,476
That's right... No matter
what happens, it's not

67
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,146
like the world turned
upside down, is it?

68
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,382
Even if you failed
the audition...

69
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,686
Life will go on like
this everyday.

70
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,555
Isn't that right, Daisuke?

71
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,290
That's right...

72
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,825
That's what it means...

73
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,060
That's right.

74
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,163
Even for me... when i lose all
my money at the horse races,

75
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,398
I feel like my life is over.

76
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,801
But when I come to work,
and I'm working like

77
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,136
crazy, before I know it, 
I forget all about it.

78
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,971
And when Saturday comes
around, I'm raring to

79
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,807
go at it again.

80
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,642
That's not the same!

81
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,644
That's exactly
what it is.

82
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:46,745
No, it's not!

83
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,113
Are you going to hit me?

84
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,550
Welcome!

85
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,956
KEN?

86
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,158
RAY told me that the miso
mackerel lunch set is

87
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,626
really good here.

88
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,228
I can use this, can't I?

89
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,166
Suree... Are you sure you
want the miso mackerel?

90
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,171
Miso mackerel, medium bowI,
large serving with extra

91
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,539
pickled vegetables.

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,241
One miso mackerel, medium
bowl, large serving with

93
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,176
extra pickled vegetables
coming right up.

94
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,887
Knowing that you like miso
mackerel gives me a sense

95
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,655
of kinship with you...

96
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,326
Did you have something to
do in this area...?

97
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,928
I have a meeting after this,
but I wanted to tell you

98
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,663
something while I'm here.

99
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,999
You wanted to tell
me something?

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,235
Your dancing at the
audition wasn't bad.

101
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,337
Really?

102
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,205
Thank you.

103
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,608
You made a mistake, an
you missed the beat of

104
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,511
the music in some places.
Your moves weren't that

105
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,882
well-executed... And you need
to build up your muscles.

106
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,251
Also, considering the
differences in your

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,821
height, you might have used
some different moves.

108
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,259
They're nothing but bad things.

109
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,396
But your dancing had the
one thing that was

110
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,931
most important...

111
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,369
You were enjoying yourselves
when you were dancing...

112
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,704
It was fun watching the
two of you dance.

113
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,552
It really was good.

114
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,754
Please come back again.

115
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,923
And...

116
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,191
What?

117
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,959
Please tell me more about
when you were dancing

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,562
with CHEAPASS and when
you were in New York.

119
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,698
If we have the chance...

120
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,705
Thank you!

121
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,717
Good for one large bowl
at Morimoto Shokudo

122
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,255
Hitomi!

123
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,858
Have you seen Yuzo?

124
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,959
Yuzo?

125
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,695
I haven't seen him
since last night.

126
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,330
While I was in the bath,
I think he went out

127
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,764
drinking somewhere.

128
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,567
I forgot all about it!

129
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,635
What?

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,136
Yuzo!

131
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,838
Where was he?

132
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,474
You idiot!

133
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,279
Where have you been?

134
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,084
What happened after that?

135
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,151
Hitomi...?

136
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,786
Here... have one.

137
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,591
I got to be real good friends
with those pick-up artists.

138
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,994
We were drinking
and dancing...

139
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,997
Bring him some water.

140
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,100
What's all the commotion?

141
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,104
Pull yourself together.

142
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,041
Dancing sure is fun!

143
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,090
Hitomi!

144
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,893
Rose!

145
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,196
I heard you failed
the audition!

146
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,666
I sure did.

147
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,201
Thinking that you would
win the audition was

148
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,604
a big mistake! Dancing
isn't that easy.

149
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,273
I'll do my best!

150
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,089
Yuka!

151
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,359
What are you you doing?

152
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,834
With so many choices, I don't
know what to get.

153
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,603
But they're all delicious.

154
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,608
I'll take 100 grams each of  the
"shirasu" (young sardines)

155
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,643
and "kyarabuki".
(stalks of butterbur in soy sauce)

156
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,845
"Shirasu" and "kyarabuki"...?

157
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,361
For some reason, this town
is really soothing.

158
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,401
You...

159
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,271
...told me last night that
even though you failed the

160
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,675
audition, after eating dinner
with everybody, you felt

161
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,644
so much better.

162
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,048
I don't have that...

163
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,085
Ever since I was little,
I hardly ever ate together

164
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,021
with my parents.

165
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,126
In exchange, there was a
housekeeper who would

166
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,728
fix my meals for me
everyday...

167
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,936
Maybe that's why I got so
caught up in dancing.

168
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:17,008
When I'm dancing, I don't
feel the loneliness.

169
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,779
It's the same or me.

170
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,416
After my mom divorced my
good-for-nothing dad,

171
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,152
she used to work until
late everyday, so...

172
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,287
I always ate by myself.

173
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,425
Then you're lucky that you
get to live with that

174
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,093
lively family now.

175
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,962
That's right, l am.

176
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,005
Can I...

177
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,108
...come by your house
for a little while?

178
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,711
Sure. Come to the house.

179
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,479
Grandpa will be happy
to see you.

180
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,380
Really?

181
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,681
Let's go.

182
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,026
I'm home!

183
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,894
I brought Yuka with me.

184
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,496
Hello...

185
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,333
I'm sorry about
the other day...

186
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,002
Our idiot neighbors had
to ruin things for you.

187
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,105
No... I should apologize
after all the trouble

188
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,974
you went through to fix the
meal, and I left early.

189
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,378
This is just a token
of my apology...

190
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,848
You didn't have
to do that...

191
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,952
I love "tsukudani".
(food boiled down in soy sauce)

192
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,787
Thank you.

193
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,122
I'd better be going.

194
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,591
Aren't you going
to come in?

195
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,526
I just came by
to apologize...

196
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,229
We didn't get to do
anything for you...

197
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,797
I'll be going.

198
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,300
I'll see her off.

199
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,176
Thank you.

200
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,044
Be careful!

201
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,650
Yuka!

202
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,121
Don't tell me you came
here just to apologizie?

203
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,932
I don't like your dancing,
but I like your house,

204
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,769
and this town.

205
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,808
See you!

206
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,478
Thank you!

207
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,514
I'll see you in school.

208
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,624
Hitomi felt like she had gotten
a little closer to Yuka.

209
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,246
Excuse me...

210
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,586
Did you want something
at your house?

211
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,355
No... it's nothing.

212
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,899
Who in the world
was that anyway?

CHAPTER 14
Mother Shows Up
Episode 80

2
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,393
I'm sorry to worry
all of you, but

3
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,328
my grandpa made a complete
recovery and is home

4
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,663
from the hospital.

5
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,131
Thank you!

6
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,165
I'm so glad.

7
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,433
Now you can do your best
without worrying about

8
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,734
anything, can't you?

9
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,836
Thank you.

10
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,305
It was tough on all of
you, too, wasn't it?

11
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,873
We've known each other 
for a long time,

12
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,374
we only did what
was expected

13
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,143
y/e .us^iave to help
each out whenever

14
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,377
anything happens.

15
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,447
Thank you so much,
everybody

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,249
From now on, I'll do my
best at dancing, at work,

17
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,585
and at home again.

18
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,995
a Ij^jjy)
Clo ninggfore...

19
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,664
Mr. Wakayama! Hello.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,603
Actually, it's
about Shota..

21
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,206
What about Shota?

22
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,426
Shota! I'm going to turn
off the light soon.

23
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,107
I see...so you're going
to enter that Dance Beat?

24
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,310
I'm so glad!

25
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,746
3 a ISO to continue
dancing with those two

26
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,916
so owTmr lievedt.<it
we decided lo do it

27
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,584
I think I'll sleep
go09 tonight.

28
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,318
Good night

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,452
Hitomi

30
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,288
I need to talk to you.

31
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,924
Sit down.

32
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,799
Actuaily, it's
about Shota.

33
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,735
What about Shota?

34
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,308
Did I tell you about Shota's
mother before?

35
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,177
Yes, you did

36
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,980
Isn't she the one who
brought Shota to the

37
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,149
child care counseling
center, and left him

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,618
there saying that she couldn't
raise him anymore?

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,922
I wouldn't exactly put
it in those words...

40
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,792
Because there were a lot of
circumstances involved.

41
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,660
What about her?

42
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,664
She contacted the center,

43
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,601
and she wants to take

44
00:03:55,602 --> 00:04:00,038
Shota back with her now

45
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,845
Why?

46
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,315
I don't know all the
details, but it's

47
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,051
probably because she's in
a situation now where

48
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,087
she can raise Shota

49
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,826
Which means that he would
leave the house

50
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,228
Of course

51
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,064
If his mother's going to
raise him, there's no

52
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,433
reason for him to
stay here

53
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,673
I can't agree with that

54
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,542
Why not?

55
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,947
Because you've put all your
effort into raising him.

56
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,783
It can't be helped...

57
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,653
After a!!, I'm just
a foster parent

58
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,692
Promise me you won't talk
about this in front

59
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,960
of the children

60
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,330
I wouldn't say anything
How could I?

61
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,179
The next day Hitomi and
Katsutaro went to the

62
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,448
child care counseling
center

63
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,421
I'm goin to explain
everything that I can

64
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,223
about what has been
going on until now

65
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,129
Ms Inoue has been in
charge of staying in

66
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,734
contact with Shota's mother
regarding his foster care.

67
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,671
Ever since spring two
years ago, I haven't

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,207
had any contact with her.

69
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,510
She moved without
letting us know

70
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,281
Last month, we suddenly got
a phone call from her

71
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:52,818
1

72
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,087
One month ago, August

73
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,088
1

74
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,528
This is the child care
counseling enter

75
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,163
Yes?

76
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,566
Ms Saito?

77
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,937
Shota's mother?

78
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,977
he s
a her living
situation had changed

79
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,113
and she wanted to
take Shota back

80
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,683
How did it change?

81
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,285
She's getting married.

82
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,522
He brings in a stable
income, so she can

83
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,258
raise Shota without
any worries.

84
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,762
And something like this
won't happen again.

85
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,499
Even if she says that,
I wonder

86
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,604
We've had quite a bit of
discussion about that, too.

hota'jgjji 1 gave birth
to him as an unwed mother

90
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,618
After that, she worked at
nig Is, and tried to

91
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,287
make a living, but she
changed jobs often,

92
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,389
f,-aftcfher income
was unstable

93
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,626
She gets lonely easily, so
she tends to rely on

94
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,963
men ot, so^she w Did
put the men ahead of

95
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,132
her child.

96
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,804
She didn't have much of a
desire to raise a child

97
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,541
so Shota wasn't getting
enough tofel.

98
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,777
Wasn't there someone else
who could look after him?

99
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,013
Shota's mother's parents
divorced when she was

100
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,249
little, and her mother
raised her. But when

101
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,553
she was in high school,
her mother passed away

102
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,588
Her father went back to
his hometown, and he's

103
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,623
still aliyfe'drid
well there

104
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,126
But they don't have

said that she's getting

married, so she wants to
take Shota and raise him.

112
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,689
But you didn't hear
from her in over two years...

113
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,124
Should we trust someone
like that?

Why don't you contact her
and have her come in

119
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,474
for an interview?

120
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,809
All right.

121
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,977

I'm really sorry

127

How is Shota doing?

128
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,531
He's living with a foster

132
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,305
you moved without
telling us.

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,641
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,143
What were you doing
for over two years?

135
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,012
You should have
contacted us

136
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,918
I was in no position
to do that.

137
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,553
I was having problems
with my boyfriend

138
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,257
Weren't you worried
about Shota?

139
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,928
I never forgot
about him

140
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,531
It's just that
I wasn't qualified

141
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,099
to raise him.

142
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,670
But you are now?

143
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,144
The man I'm going to marry
says he'll help me

144
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,146
to raise him, too.

145
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,249
I'm planning to leave my
current job by the

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,984
end of this year

147
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,420
I'll concentrate on
being

148
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,857
This time, I as

149
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,997
As far as
her desire to raise

150
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,399
Shota is very strong

151
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,536
Of course, we have to
check into the actual

152
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,472
living situation, too

153
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,376
In order to do that, we
paid her a home visit.

154
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:12,944
We had her fiance
come over, too.

155
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,145
We had her fiance
come over, too.

156
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,489
Are you living
here now?

157
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,891
No, we're not living
together yet..

158
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,861
Although, I spend the
night once in a while.

159
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,730
We're looking for a place
now where the three of

160
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,164
us can live

161
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,800
We'll find something
this year... won't we?

162
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,969
We plan to register our
marriage this year,

163
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,072
but the wedding probably
won't be until next year

164
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,208
I see... What kind of
work do you do?

165
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,980
My parents have a Japanese
restaurant in Akasaka
Mikie's fiance: Imasaka Iitsuru

166
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,082
It's an old traditional
restaurant, and I'll

167
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,585
eventually take over. But
right now my mother

168
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,221
is running the restaurant.

169
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,156
I'm in charge of a branch
we have in Shinjuku

170
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,524
tlepartment st 1

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,862
In that case, you'll have
a stable income

172
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,398
I guess..

173
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,802
Just in case.

174
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,239
I brought last year's
withholding form

175
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,842
If you don't mind,
I'll have a look.

176
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,949
We couldn't find any fault
with her fiance's income,

177
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,218
and he understands what
happened with Shota

178
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,321
and seemed willing
to raise him

179
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,359
It looks like her life
has stabilized

180
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,429
She's more stable
mentally too

181
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,131
There was a big difference
from how she was before

182
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,071
So after taking all of this
under consideration,

183
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,474
we decided that she's
presently qualified

184
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,745
to take Shota in
and raise him.

185
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,650
1

186
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,052
I understand

187
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,289
Thank you for
understanding.

188
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:12,697
The next step is for
us to talk to Shota

189
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,468
We have to think of
Shota first, so we

190
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,071
want to see how he feels
about Jus er

191
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:25,110
and if he wants
to see his mother

192
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,879
eil have a ps ch 1o ist
come a o ith s

193
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,549
Do you think you could
bring Shota over here

194
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,220
without telling him
about his mother?

195
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,724
r we can come
to get him.

196
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,730
No... I'll bring
him here

197
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,099
Thank you.

198
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,870
Mr. Wakayama.. 7

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,941
I can't agree
with this.

200
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,010
What are you
saying, Hitomi?

201
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,779
Do you agree with them?

202
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,983
Of course I do

203
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,354
They explained 
to us very carefully.

204
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,390
HoW can you agree
to this?

205
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,392
It's so sudden!

206
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,194
You're going to just
bring Shota here

207
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,862
all of a sudden

208
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,264
Stop , Hitomi

209
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,298
1

210
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,533
h or>

211
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:27,405
Because you raised him la
with a lot of love

212
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,043
You cared for him, and
SCO
Icied
him. and ou

213
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,913
put all that effort
into raising him

214
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,187
Yi someone like that
really raise Shota?

215
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,589
Don't talk like that

216
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,357
She's Shota's mother

217
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,625
But .

218
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,728
She's Shota's mother!

219
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,966
She's the mother who
gave birth to him...

220
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,435
She's his real mother

221
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,604
Hitomi..

222
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,073
I understand how
you feel but

223
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,677
I want you to think
about Shota.

224
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,448
Shota's mother has finally
been able to make an

225
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,952
environment where she can
raise him properly

226
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,122
There are a number of
situations, but if

227
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,192
we think about Shota,
it's best for him

228
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,561
to live with his
real parent.

229
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,164
Excuse me, but
I'm leaving.

230
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Hitomi!

231
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,634
I'll go after her

232
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,169
It's okay

233
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:37,308
II maffe her
understand

234
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,645
I'm sorry s e was
orude to on

235
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,113
I'm sorry..

236
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,716
No, it's all right

CHAPTER 9
I'm Getting Married
Episode 54
2
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,908
This Saturday, meet at the Aoyama office like
3
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,109
the last
4
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,811
time.
5
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,145
Be there at 6AM.
6
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,847
That's so early!
7
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,348
It's too early.
8
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,184
This will be a business trip
9
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,418
It's in Atami
10
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,753
Atami?
11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,320
ATAMI
12
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,355
13
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:34,193
14
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,007
Thanks for waiting. Shall we go?
15
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,278
This is a regular hot springs inn, isn't it?
16
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,847
That's right
17
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,015
So where are we going to dance?
18
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,384
As you'd expect at a place like this
19
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,153
In a banquet room
20
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,588
A banquet room?
21
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,192
Excuse me
22
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,094
This is a little too tight
23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,562
I'm sorry
24
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,398
I was dumb!
25
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,102
I thought we'd be on a Las Vegas-style stage
26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,704
You're too naive
27
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,839
Did you forget? This is "Eyebrow Cats"
28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,708
Will the guests be drinking?
29
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,077
I'm sure they will be.
30
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,146
We're going to dance for a bunch of drunks.
31
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,015
I can't do that.
32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,517
I don't want to
33
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,652
I'm going to turn it down.
34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,187
Wait, Yuka!
35
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,490
Excuse me
36
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:39,725
We can't dance for a bunch of drunks.
37
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,261
We can't dance for a bunch of drunks.
38
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,997
There's no alcohol at this banquet
39
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,265
It's entertainment for the local seniors club
40
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,299
It's entertainment for the local seniors club
41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,201
Seniors club?
42
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:49,935
Right.
43
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,703
It was supposed to be
44
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,805
an "enka" singer impersonator
45
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,274
But at the last minute he couldn't make it
46
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,808
So we got the job instead
47
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,713
Try to get them to join in like last time
48
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,149
There's a dressing room back there, so you
49
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,751
can get ready.
50
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,319
If you want to to practice, there's video
51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,854
and everything
52
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,989
We're counting on you
53
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,262
So, at least they won't be drinking!
54
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,847
It's like another era
55
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,283
Like being in the Showa era.
56
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,055
I wonder if they will get into the "Eyebrow Cats"?
57
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,891
From the start, they won't be interested
58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,759
Since they came expecting to hear
59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,161
some "enka" singer.
60
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,195
Shall we dance to enka music?
61
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:50,996
No way
62
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,231
Then what are we going to do?
63
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,733
Let's just decide if we're going to do it or not.
64
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,035
You mean you would come all the way here and 
65
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,170
go home without doing the job??
66
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,304
It can't be helped.
67
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,772
I just don't fee! like dancing
68
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,374
That's not professional.
69
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,376
What is 'professional" anyway?
70
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,345
Finishing the job you're asked to do.
71
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't agree with you
72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,716
If you can't show them something you think is good,
73
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,985
I don't think you can fulfill your responsibility as a pro.
74
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,319
You're too logical.
75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,187
What do you mean?
76
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,622
That's why you always end up fighting at the pub
77
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,156
She just ignores the customer's order,
78
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,092
and tells them what she thinks is better.
79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,894
At a restaurant, the sommelier recommends
80
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,296
the wine, doesn't she?
81
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,298
It's a pub, so shut up and bring
82
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,633
what the customer orders
83
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,068
Let's not fight about the pub right now
84
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,703
Okay
85
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,905
As your manager I have something to say
86
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:39,278
It's reasonable for us to quit this job
87
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,647
No! I want to do it
88
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,383
But Hitomi
89
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,653
Why do you want to do it?
90
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,756
I have a feeling that if we quit now, the four
91
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,791
of us won't be able to dance together again
92
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,559
I want to do it...
93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,762
I want us to connect as a unit
94
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,196
I'm not sold on the idea of "unit" but
95
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,598
I like your determination!
96
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,367
You can't dance on guts alone..
97
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,336
You have to have an idea
98
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,238
How about this?
99
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,773
What is it?
100
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,075
It's a "Bon" dance record
101
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,810
It has the dance moves, too.
102
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,345
Let me see that
103
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,050
Can we use it?
104
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,752
I think we can use some of this
105
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,488
Will it work?
106
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,624
Let's give it a try
107
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,779
Don't laugh like that. Why'd you suddenly try dancing?
108
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,655
When I went to the club with Hitomi
109
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,757
I realized if I get good at it
110
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,463
I'll look really cool
111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,531
the next time I go with her
112
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,966
Next!
113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,838
It would make you look good, wouldn't it?
114
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,407
Okay... together now
115
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,450
But I was surprised at Keiko's announcement.
116
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,719
Didn't you like that Katsumata?
117
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,689
How could I like him?
118
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,625
I don't know about this web or IT stuff, but
119
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,694
that guy can't even carry a portable shrine
120
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,296
Yuzo, you really love Keiko, don't you?
121
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,300
Of course not! Who wants a tomboy like that?
122
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,936
I'm just worried about her,
123
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,338
She's like a little sister to me.
124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,543
I'm a little worried about that Katsumata, too
125
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,513
Right?
126
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,783
They've only been dating for 6 months
127
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,918
Love that starts out too hot
128
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,787
burns up quick
129
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,555
That's just it
130
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,956
It's been six months
131
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,459
After six months, already her fiance
132
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,895
just seems tired.
133
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,132
A lot of my predictions like this have been wrong
134
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,836
The couples I think won't last long, end up happy
135
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,641
So that means this one will work out
136
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,210
What are you talking about?
137
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,056
They look like a hard audience to please.
138
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,298
If we can get this crowd going
139
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,799
it will be amazing, won't it?
140
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,601
I'm determined now
141
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,837
That's surprising, Yuka
142
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,407
I just love a challenge
143
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,946
It's almost time. Standby
144
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,961
Good afternoon, all of you in the 'Full of Life Club'
145
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,631
Did you enjoy the hot springs bath?
146
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,933
There's nothing better!
147
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:29,007
Next up on stage is "Eyebrow Cats"
148
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,676
Here they are
149
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,179
Please give them a hand
150
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,759
"Eyebrow Cats" Bon Dance version
151
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,460
WAKE UP!
152
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,829
Wake up wake up wake up!
153
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:28,833
It's a "Bon" dance See?
154
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,635
It's a "Bon" dance. See?
155
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,807
What do you know! Isn't it fun?
156
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,123
That was a disaster, wasn't it?
157
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,926
I thought it would be a hit with them.
158
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,528
it's not easy being a dancer
159
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,898
Good work
160
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,835
Different from the last time
161
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,970
But you got them going
162
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,506
They're energetically playing bingo
163
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,710
I thought I was requesting
164
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,012
the impossible from you
165
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,581
Please don't be upset, and work with us again
166
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,719
Here's your fee for today, and in place of a bonus,
167
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,489
I'm giving you coupons to use the hot springs bath
168
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,258
Please use it until this evening.
169
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,000
I guess we'll just take what we can get
170
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:10,935
Let's go.
171
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,909
Ready?
172
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,723
Hitomi...you're really good at getting people
173
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,491
to do things, aren't you?
174
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,861
You talked me into it again today
175
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,736
I just want to do things together
176
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,740
That's what I like about dancing
177
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,211
When I felt lonely in Sapporo, I found
178
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,813
friends through dancing
179
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,213
180
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,222
Friends, huh?
181
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,793
That might not be a bad thing
182
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,497
I'm going to play, too
183
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,432
You'll play pingpong?
184
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:15,467
Really? Surprising!
185
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,180
What! It's Mr. Katsumata
186
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,184
What a coincidence
187
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,921
Thanks for waiting.
188
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,291
What's this?
189
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,459
Cute, isn't it?
190
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,527
It's cute.
191
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,195
Is it a matching set?
192
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,498
Shall we go?
193
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,534
But he wasn't there with Keiko...

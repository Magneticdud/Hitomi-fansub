CHAPTER 9
"I'm Getting Married"
Episode 54

2
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:15,556
This Saturday, meet at the Aoyama office like

3
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:16,757
the last time.

4
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:18,492
Ok.

5
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:19,794
Be there at 6AM.

6
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,495
That's so early!

7
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:22,997
It's too early.

8
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,832
This will be a business trip.

9
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,066
It's in Atami.

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,401
Atami?

11
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:33,840
ATAMI

12
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,655
Thanks for waiting. Shall we go?

13
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:52,926
This is a regular hot springs inn, isn't it?

14
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:54,494
That's right.

15
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,662
So where are we going to dance?

16
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,031
As you'd expect at a place like this...

17
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,800
In a banquet room.

18
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,235
A banquet room?

19
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:06,872
Excuse me!

20
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:08,741
This is a little too tight.

21
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:10,242
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,045
I was dumb!

23
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:16,782
I thought we'd be on a Las Vegas-style stage.

24
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,350
You're too naive...

25
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,485
Did you forget? This is "Eyebrow Cats".

26
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,354
Will the guests be drinking?

27
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,723
I'm sure they will be.

28
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,792
We're going to dance for a bunch of drunks.

29
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,661
I can't do that.

30
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,162
I don't want to.

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,331
I'm going to turn it down.

32
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:34,833
Wait, Yuka!

33
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:38,169
Excuse me.

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,940
We can't dance for a bunch of drunks.

35
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,642
There's no alcohol at this banquet.

36
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,944
It's entertainment for the local seniors club.

37
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:48,880
Seniors club?

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,580
Right.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,382
It was supposed to be

40
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:53,451
an "enka" singer impersonator.
(Enka is Japanese folk)

41
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:54,952
But at the last minute he couldn't make it...

42
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:56,454
So we got the job instead.

43
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:01,392
Try to get them to join in like last time.

44
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,794
There's a dressing room back there, so you

45
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,429
can get ready.

46
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,964
If you want to to practice, there's video

47
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:08,532
and everything.

48
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,634
We're counting on you.

49
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,940
So, at least they won't be drinking!

50
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,491
It's like another era.

51
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,960
Like being in the Showa era.

52
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:42,732
I wonder if they will get into the "Eyebrow Cats"?

53
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,568
From the start, they won't be interested...

54
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,403
Since they came expecting to hear

55
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,837
some "enka" singer.

56
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:49,872
Shall we dance to enka music?

57
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:50,673
No way!

58
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:51,907
Then what are we going to do?

59
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:54,410
Let's just decide if we're going to do it or not.

60
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,712
You mean you would come all the way here, and

61
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:57,846
go home without doing the job?

62
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,981
It can't be helped.

63
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,449
I just don't fee! like dancing.

64
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,050
That's not professional.

65
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,052
What is "professional" anyway?

66
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,021
Finishing the job you're asked to do.

67
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,356
I don't agree with you.

68
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:10,392
If you can't show them something you think is good,

69
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:12,660
I don't think you can fulfill your responsibility as a pro.

70
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,962
You're too logical.

71
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:14,863
What do you mean?

72
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,297
That's why you always end up fighting at the pub.

73
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,832
She just ignores the customer's order,

74
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,767
and tells them what she thinks is better.

75
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,570
At a restaurant, the sommelier recommends

76
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,971
the wine, doesn't she?

77
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:25,940
It's a pub, so shut up and bring

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,308
what the customer orders.

79
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,710
Let's not fight about the pub right now.

80
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,379
Okay.

81
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,581
As your manager, I have something to say.

82
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:38,953
It's reasonable for us to quit this job.

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,321
No! I want to do it.

84
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,057
But Hitomi... !

85
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,327
Why do you want to do it?

86
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,430
I have a feeling that if we quit now, the four

87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,466
of us won't be able to dance together again.

88
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,201
I want to do it...

89
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,436
I want us to connect as a unit.

90
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:57,871
I'm not sold on the idea of "unit", but

91
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,272
I like your determination!

92
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,041
You can't dance on guts alone..

93
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,010
You have to have an idea.

94
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:05,912
How about this?

95
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,447
What is it?

96
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,749
It's a "Bon" dance record.

97
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,484
It has the dance moves, too.

98
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,019
Let me see that.

99
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:17,723
Can we use it?

100
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,426
I think we can use some of this.

101
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:23,162
Will it work?

102
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:25,297
Let's give it a try.

103
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,452
Don't laugh like that. Why'd you suddenly try dancing?

104
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:56,327
When I went to the club with Hitomi...

105
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,429
Wait... next pose.

106
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,135
So the next time I go with her, if I'm really good

107
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:06,203
at it, it would make me look good.

108
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:07,638
Next!

109
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,510
It would make you look good, wouldn't it?

110
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,079
Okay... together now.

111
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:25,122
But I was surprised at Keiko's announcement.

112
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:27,391
Didn't you like that Katsumata?

113
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:30,360
How could I like him?

114
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,296
I don't know about this web or IT stuff, but

115
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:35,365
that guy can't even carry a portable shrine.

116
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,967
Yuzo, you really love Keiko, don't you?

117
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:41,971
Of course not! Who wants a tomboy like that?

118
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,607
I'm just worried about her,

119
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,009
She's like a little sister to me.

120
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,214
I'm a little worried about that Katsumata, too.

121
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,183
Right?

122
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:57,453
They've only been dating for 6 months.

123
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:59,588
Love that starts out too hot

124
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,457
burns up quick.

125
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,225
That's just it.

126
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,627
It's been six months.

127
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:07,129
After six months, he's already her fiancé.

128
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,565
I just remembered...

129
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,802
A lot of my predictions like this have been wrong.

130
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:17,506
The couples I think won't last long, end up happy.

131
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,310
So that means this one will work out.

132
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:24,879
What are you talking about?

133
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,725
They look like a hard audience to please.

134
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:45,966
If we can get this crowd going

135
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,468
it will be amazing, won't it?

136
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,270
I'm determined now.

137
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,505
That's surprising, Yuka.

138
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,075
I just love a challenge!

139
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,614
It's almost time... standby.

140
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,628
Good afternoon, all of you in the "Full of Life Club".

141
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,299
Did you enjoy the hot springs bath?

142
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,601
There's nothing better!

143
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,674
Next up on stage is not "Maneki Neko",
(it's the traditional porcelain lucky cat)

144
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,344
but "Mayuge Neko" (eyebrow cats).

145
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,846
Please give them a hand.

146
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,426
"Eyebrow Cats" Bon Dance version

147
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,126
Hey! Wake up!

148
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,495
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

149
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,301
It's a "Bon" dance. See?

150
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:35,472
What do you think? Isn't it fun?

151
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,787
That was a disaster, wasn't it?

152
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,589
I thought it would be a hit with them.

153
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,192
It's not easy being a dancer.

154
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,562
Good work.

155
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,498
It was different from the last time,

156
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,633
but you got them going,

157
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,169
they're energetically playing bingo.

158
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,373
I thought I was requesting

159
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,674
the impossible from you.

160
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,243
Please don't be upset, and work with us again.

161
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:54,382
Here's your fee for today, and in place of a bonus,

162
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:57,151
I'm giving you coupons to use the hot springs bath.

163
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:59,920
Please use it.

164
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,662
I guess we'll just take what we can get.

165
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,597
Let's go.

166
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:17,571
Ready?

167
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:31,384
Hitomi... you're really good at getting people

168
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,153
to do things, aren't you?

169
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,522
You talked me into it again today.

170
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:44,397
I just want to do things together.

171
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,401
That's what I like about dancing.

172
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,872
When I felt lonely in Sapporo, I found

173
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:54,473
friends through dancing.

174
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:03,882
Friends, huh?

175
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,453
That might not be a bad thing.

176
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:12,157
I'm going to play, too.

177
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:14,092
You'll play pingpong?

178
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,694
Really? Surprising!

179
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,840
What! It's Mr. Katsumata!

180
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,844
What a coincidence.

181
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:36,580
Thanks for waiting.

182
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,950
What's this?

183
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,118
Cute, isn't it?

184
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,186
It's cute.

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,854

186
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,156
Shall we go?

187
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,193

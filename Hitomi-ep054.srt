the Showa era.

56
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,055
wonder iflbl ^folks would find the
Mayuge Neko" entertaining?

57
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,891
They won't be interested
from the beginning

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,759
ifstfe they amejiere
ex Acting t5 hear

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,161
some "enka" singer.

60
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,195
Shall we dance to
erska'* music9

61
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:50,996
No way

62
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,231
Then what are we
going to do?

63
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,733
Let's just decide if we're
gbing to do it or not v

64
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,035
u mean you would c6ftie
all the way here, and

65
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,170
go home without
doing the job**

66
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,304
It can't be hei fed.

67
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,772
I just don't fee!
like dancing

68
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,374
That's not professional.

69
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,376
What is 'professional" anyway?

70
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,345
Finishing what f %y
ask you to do

71
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't agree with you

72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,716
f you can't show them something
that you thi?ik is good,

73
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,985
I don't think you can fulfill y ur
responsibility as a professional.

74
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,319
You're too logical.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,187
What do you mean?

76
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,622
That's why you always end
up fighting at the pub

77
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,156
She jDst ignores the
customer's order,

78
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,092
and tells them wh t she
thinks is better.

79
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,894
When you go o a restaurant,
the sommelier recommends

80
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,296
tHe Wine,-doesn't Jie?

81
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,298
t's apub, so you
haveto<J<Hs bring

82
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,633
whaijhetustomer orders^

83
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,068
"et'sYiot fight about
the pub right now

84
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,703
Okay

85
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,905
As your manager fl have
something to say

86
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:39,278
think it can't be help if
we deci e not to do >i!s

87
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,647
No* want to do it

88
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,383
But Hitomi *

89
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,653
hat's your reas for
wanting to do this"?

90
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,756
I have a feeling that if
we quit now, the four

91
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,791
of us t be able to
dance togef ■ V again

92
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,559
I want to do it...

93
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,762
To^elp us o
form a un .

94
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,196
ot Id on the
dea of uhit, .but

95
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,598
like our spirit

96
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,367
ou W ance with
u t spirit alone..

97
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,336
You ave to have an idea

98
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,238
How about this?

99
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,773
What is it?

100
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,075
It's a "bon" dance re d

101
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,810
ft has the dance
moves, too.

102
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,345
Let me see that

103
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,050
Can we use it?

104
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,752
1 think we might be able
o use some of this

105
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,488
Will it wo K>

106
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,624
Let's give it a tr

107
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,779
What made you suddenly
want to leam to dance?

108
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,655
I realized heft 1 went to
the club with Hitomi..

109
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,757
ukciy neA< j;u.btj.

110
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,463
So the next time I go with
her, if I'm really good

111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,531
at it, it would make
me look good

112
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,966
Next!

113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,838
T tit would make ou look
good, wouldn't it?

114
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,407
Okay... together now

115
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,450
But was surprised at
Keiko s announcement.

116
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,719
idn't you like
(hat Katsumata?

117
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,689
How could I like him?

118
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,625
I don't know about Ihis
web or IT stuff, but

119
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,694
that guy can't even carry
a portable shrine

120
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,296
now^oii really love
eiko, don't you?

I'm just worried abou"her,

123
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,338

They look like a hard
audience to please.
